Asparagus Pesto Pasta

4 to 6 servings

1 bunch asparagus spears (about 1 pound), trimmed of tough ends and halved crosswise
3 handfuls baby spinach leaves
2 cloves garlic, peeled
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping
1 cup pine nuts
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for topping
Juice of ½ lemon
½ teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
8 ounces of dried pasta or 12 ounces fresh -linguini, fettuccini, spaghetti

Bring 2 pots of water to a rolling boil, one large for the pasta and one
medium sized for the asparagus. While the water is heating, put the pine
nuts in a single layer in a large skillet. Heat on medium heat, stirring
occasionally, until fragrant and lightly browned. Remove pine nuts from pan
and set aside. You will use ¾ cup of the pine nuts for the pesto paste and
¼ cup to mix in whole.
Salt the asparagus water and drop the spears into the pan. Cook for only 2
or 3 minutes, until the spears are bright green and barely tender. Drain
under cool water to stop the cooking. Cut the tips off, and set aside,
several of the asparagus (diagonal cut about an inch from the end) to use
for garnish.
Add the asparagus, spinach, garlic, Parmesan, and 3/4 cup of the pine nuts
to a food processor. Purée and, with the motor running, drizzle in the 1/4
cup of olive oil until a paste forms. If too thick, thin it with a bit of
the pasta water. Add the lemon juice and salt, taste and adjust seasoning.
Salt the pasta water well and cook the pasta until just tender. Drain and
toss immediately with 1 cup of the asparagus pesto. Serve sprinkled with
the remaining ¼ cup toasted pine nuts, a dusting of Parmesan, and a light
drizzle of olive oil.
