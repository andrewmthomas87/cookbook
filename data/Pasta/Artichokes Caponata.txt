Artichokes Caponata

4 servings

8 to 12 baby artichokes
Lemon juice
3 tablespoons plus 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
½ medium onions, cut into medium dice
1 small carrot, peeled and chopped into rough ¼-inch dice
12 green olives pitted, preferably Sicilian variety
1 tablespoon salt packed capers, rinsed and dried
2 whole chilies
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons tomato paste
3 salt packed anchovy fillets, soaked in milk, rinsed, patted dry, chopped
4 canned plum tomatoes, peeled and seeded
4 tablespoons red wine vinegar
4 heaping tablespoons granulated sugar

Using a bread knife, carefully slice off the tips of the artichokes, remove
all of the tough outer leaves, and using a paring knife peel the base. Cut
each artichoke into quarters and remove the choke, as well as any prickly
tips that may have formed on the inner leaves. Place in water with lemon
juice. Drain. Cut each of these quarters into halves, to make wedges.
In a medium saucepan, heat 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, add
onions, carrots, olives, capers, chilies, and drained artichokes. Season
with salt and pepper. Toss to caramelize. Add more olive oil, season, add
tomato paste and let ingredients bubble rapidly. Add anchovies. During the
last 5 minutes add tomatoes. Add red wine vinegar and sugar and reduce 1
minute.
Serve hot or at room temperature over pasta and with a salad.
