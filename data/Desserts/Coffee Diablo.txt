Demitasse cups for serving

1	cup Triple Sec or Cointreau (using ladle)

8	whole cloves
3	cups strong coffee

Light sterno under chafing dish, the quickly add the brandy, Triple Sec, cinnamon stick and whole allspice. While the liquid is warming, spiral peel the orange and lemon, ending up with two equal lengths of peel about 1 inch wide. Insert four whole cloves into the bottom ends of the two peels about 1 inch apart. Skewer the top ends of the orange and lemon peels on separate tines of the metal fork and intertwine them to hang vertically with the cloves at the bottom.
Light the warm liquor in the chafing dish and dip the orange and lemon peels into the flames. Hold the orange and lemon peels on the fork directly above the flaming liquor, then using the metal ladle; gently pour the flaming liquor from the top of the orange and lemon peels so it spirals down into the chafing dish. Repeat until the cloves begin to glow red, then put the orange and lemon peel directly into the liquor. Add three ladles of the strong coffee; stir, and then serve in the demitasse cups. If the serving it timed properly, there should be a blue flame on top of each cup as it is served.
