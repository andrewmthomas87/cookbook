Chocolate Velvet Cake - Four Seasons

8-10 pieces

Start with a basic sponge cake prepared in a large cookie pan.
Mousse Ingredients:
3	egg yolks
1	tablespoon instant coffee
¼	cup kirsch
¼	cup rum
¼	cup Crème de Cacao
⅓	cup praline paste
6	tablespoons melted butter
1½	pounds semi-sweet chocolate
3	egg whites
pinch of salt
¼	teaspoon confectioner’s sugar
2	cups heavy cream, whipped
Icing Ingredients:
9	ounces bittersweet chocolate
8	ounces cup heavy cream
1	Tablespoon Cognac

Cake: Completely line a round 1-quart mold with basic sponge cake by cutting out a round to fit the bottom of the mold. Then, from the remaining cake cut one long or two short strips to cover the sides. Reserve any cake left to make into a top.
Mousse: Mix egg yolks, coffee, liqueurs and praline paste. Beat until smooth. Heat butter to hot and add. Heat melted chocolate to hot and add. Add the pinch of salt to the egg whites and beat until they form soft peaks. Add sugar, a tablespoonful at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating 5 more minutes, or until very stiff. Fold whipped cream and beaten egg whites into the original mixture.
Assembly: Pour mousse into sponge-cake lined mold. Place in refrigerator for 2 hours, or until filling is firm. Cover top with remaining sponge cake, fitting together any bits and pieces if there is not a single piece big enough. Loosen sides of mold with a sharp knife. Turn out upside down on a plate. Frost all over with semi-sweet chocolate icing (below).
Icing Instructions:
Break chocolate into pieces and process in a food processor until very fine, remove to a heavy saucepan. Heat cream to boiling point and pour three quarters of it over the chocolate. Cover for a few minutes to allow chocolate to melt. Gently stir together until smooth, trying not to create air bubbles in a steady stream. Gently stir in the Cognac and allow to cool until just tepid.
