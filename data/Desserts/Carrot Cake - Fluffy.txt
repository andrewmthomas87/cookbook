Peel and trim carrots; cut into chunks. Tumble in a large saucepan. Cover with cold water. Boil tender for 20 minutes. Drain any remaining water. Swirl in food processor until smooth. Measure out 1 cup of the resulting puree. Cool
Whisk together the flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon and salt.
Use an electric mixer on high to fluff the butter for 2 minutes. Cascade in all but 2 tablespoons of the sugar; fluff another 2 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time. Switch to low speed; add the flour mixture and carrot puree in alternating scoops until the batter glows a smooth pale orange.
Beat 4 egg whites in a copper bowl until foamy; add remaining 2 tablespoonsof the sugar and beat glossy. Use a rubber spatula to fold the egg whites gently and thoroughly into the carrot batter.
Divide the batter among three buttered and floured 9-inch cake pans. Bake at 350F until a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean, 25 minutes. Cool.
In a copper bowl, beat 4 more egg whites with one cup of sugar, then heat over a sauce pan of water to 160F. Whisk until fluffy and cool, then with an electric mixer, whisk in the 8 ounces of softened cream cheese and the 1 cup of softened butter. Add the drop of vanilla extract and chill.
To frost, center one layer on a cake platter. Frost evenly with the cream-cheese fluff. Scatter on half of the pecans. Stack with a second layer of the cake, fluff and pecans. Top with the third cake layer. Smooth fluff over the top and sides and decorate with a fresh flower.
