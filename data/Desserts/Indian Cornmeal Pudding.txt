Indian Cornmeal Pudding

4 to 6 servings

4	cups whole milk
½	cup molasses
¾	cup sugar
½	cup cornmeal
1	teaspoon ground cinnamon
½	teaspoon ground ginger
½	teaspoon salt
3	tablespoons butter, more for greasing pan

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, put 3½ cups milk. Add molasses and sugar, and stir; when they are incorporated, turn heat to low. Heat oven to 300F.
Slowly sprinkle cornmeal over warm milk mixture, stirring or whisking all the while; break up any lumps. When mixture thickens after 10 minutes or so, stir in all remaining ingredients, except for the remaining milk, and turn off heat.
Grease an 8 or 9 inch square baking dish or similar size gratin dish and turn warm mixture into it; top with remaining ½ cup milk; do not stir. Bake 2½ to 3 hours, or until pudding is set. Serve warm, cold or at room temperature. Wrapped well and refrigerated, this keeps for several days.
