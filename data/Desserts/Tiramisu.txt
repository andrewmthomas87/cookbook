Tiramisu

6 servings

4	ounces strong espresso, or 2 teaspoons instant coffee dissolved in ½ cup water
2	ounces Italian brandy
4	egg yolks
2	tablespoons sugar
2	egg whites
2	cups mascarpone
3	ounces bittersweet chocolate, broken into ¼-inch pieces
3	ounces milk chocolate, shaved or grated
30	small savoiardi (Lady Fingers), or 15, broken in half

Mix the coffee and brandy together and set aside.
Over a double boiler, beat egg yolks and sugar until mixture lightens in color and forms ribbons when the whisk is lifted from the pot. Allow to cool 5 minutes.
Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks. Fold the mascarpone into the egg yolk mixture ¼ at a time. Fold mascarpone-yolk mixture into the egg whites and set aside.
Line a straight-sided dish with Lady Fingers, then fill with the mixture.
Individual Tiramisu - Lay the savoiardi along the insides of the wine goblets all the way to the bottom, lining the entire glass, keeping 6 savoiardi for later use. Using a pastry brush, paint the cookies with the espresso and brandy mixture. Fill each goblet one-third full with the mascarpone mixture and sprinkle with the broken chocolate. Lay 1 remaining cookie across the center of each goblet and paint with the coffee mixture. Fill each goblet with the remaining mascarpone mixture, topping each with the shaved chocolate. Serve at room temperature.
