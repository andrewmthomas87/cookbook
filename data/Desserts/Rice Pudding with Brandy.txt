Rice Pudding with Brandy

6 servings

½	cup each: brandy, dark raisins
1	stick (½ cup) plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1	cup each: sugar, short-grain rice
6	cups milk
1¼	cups whipping cream
1	vanilla bean, scored lengthwise, seeds removed, reserved
⅛	teaspoon salt

Preheat the oven to 325F.
Pour the brandy over the raisins in a small bowl; set aside.
Place the butter and sugar in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook until the butter melts, about 1 minute; heat to a boil. Cook, without stirring, until mixture turns a golden caramel color, about 20 minutes; carefully stir in the rice. Add the milk and cream. (The liquid will become hard and stringy; it will become smooth again when heated.) Add the vanilla bean and seeds and salt. Heat to a boil; stir until combined.
Cover; transfer to the oven. Cook until mixture is creamy and top is golden brown, about 1½ to 2 hours. Spoon the hot rice pudding into deep bowls.
