Pears Poached in Coffee

6 servings

6	firm-ripe pears with stems
2	cups leftover coffee
⅓	cup brown sugar
1	teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1	tablespoon or so of Marsala
6	slices of pound cake about ½” thick

Peel pears leaving stem intact, then remove cores from pears from the bottom using a melon baller or small, sharp spoon. Cut bottom of pear so it will stand flat.
Heat coffee and sugar in large saucepan until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to simmer. Add pears; simmer, covered, until pears are tender but not soft, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Transfer the pears to a bowl. Cook the syrup until reduced to about ⅔ cup, then combine it with the pears. Cool. The liquid should get syrupy. Add liqueur if desired.
Set each pear on top of a slice of pound cake in a small deep dish, then drizzle some of the syrup on top. Add some thin slices of chocolate plus some toasted slivered almonds and serve with a small scoop of burnt caramel or coffee ice cream alongside pear.
