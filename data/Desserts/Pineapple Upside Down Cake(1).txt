Pineapple Upside-Down Cake

8 servings

For batter:
1½	cups all-purpose flour
2	to 3 teaspoons ground cardamom
2	teaspoons baking powder
¼	teaspoon salt
¾	stick unsalted butter, softened
1	cup granulated sugar
2	large eggs
1	teaspoon vanilla
1	tablespoon dark rum
½	cup unsweetened pineapple juice
2	tablespoons dark rum, for sprinkling
For topping:
1	can Dole pineapple slices in syrup
Maraschino Cherries
¾	stick unsalted butter
¾	cup packed light brown sugar
¼	cup honey (preferably Greek honey)

Preheat oven to 350F.
Topping: Open pineapple and reserve juice. Melt butter in skillet. Add brown sugar and simmer over moderate heat, stirring, 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Arrange pineapple slices on top of sugar mixture in concentric circles, cutting and fitting the pieces to make a solid coating of pineapple. Place one maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple slice. Drizzle the honey over the pineapple.
Batter: Sift together flour, cardamom, baking powder, and salt. Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, and then gradually beat in granulated sugar. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla and rum. Add ½ of the flour mixture and beat on low speed just until blended. Beat in pineapple juice, then add remaining flour mixture, beating just until blended. (Batter may appear slightly curdled.)
Spoon batter over pineapple topping and spread evenly. Bake cake in middle of oven until golden and a tester comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let cake stand in skillet 5 minutes. Invert a plate over skillet and invert cake onto plate (keeping plate and skillet firmly pressed together). Replace any pineapple stuck to bottom of skillet. Sprinkle rum over cake and cool on plate on a rack. Serve cake just warm or at room temperature. Cake may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring to room temperature before serving.
NOTE: Double batter recipe for larger iron skillet.
