Caramel Soufflé

1 large or 8 individual soufflés

1	cup Creamy Caramel sauce at room temperature (separate recipe)
3	large egg yolks, at room temperature
9	large egg whites, at room temperature
Pinch of cream of tartar (less than ⅛ teaspoon)
⅓	cup sugar

Preheat the oven to 425F and adjust the rack to the lower third of the oven.
Brush the inside of 8 (8-ounce) ramekins or 1 large soufflé dish with melted butter and then lightly but completely dust the inside with sugar.
Whisk together the caramel sauce and egg yolks in a medium bowl. This mixture is the soufflé base.
Using an electric mixer, whip the egg whites for about 30 seconds or until soft foam appears. Add the cream of tartar and continue to whip the whites for 2 minutes. Add the sugar and beat until the egg whites reach the medium-stiff peak stage.
Using a rubber spatula, fold one-third of the egg whites into the caramel mixture to lighten the base. Fold in the remaining whites carefully so that the mixture is not deflated.
Spoon the soufflé into the dish or dishes, filling them to the rim. Gently run a paring knife around the inner wall of the ramekin, and then place a buttered foil collar around each. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes for individual soufflés or 30 to 40 minutes for a large soufflé. When finished, the soufflés should be tall, golden brown, dry on the edges and a little creamy in the center.
Remove aluminum foil collars, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve immediately.
