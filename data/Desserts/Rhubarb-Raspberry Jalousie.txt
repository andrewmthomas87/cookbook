Rhubarb-Raspberry Jalousie

6-8 servings

2	tablespoons unsalted butter (¼ stick)
4	cups ½ inch thick slices of fresh rhubarb (or frozen)
1	cup raspberry preserves with seeds
¼	cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1	sheet frozen puff pastry (half package of Pepperidge Farms)
1	large egg, beaten to blend (for glaze)
Vanilla ice cream

Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add rhubarb, cover and simmer until rhubarb is tender and falling apart, about 10-15 minutes. Add preserves and ¼ cup sugar. Cook uncovered until very thick and reduced to about 2 cups, stirring frequently, about 35 minutes.
Refrigerate filing uncovered until cold, at least one hour. (Can be prepared 2 days in advance if covered and refrigerated.)
Preheat oven to 400F. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 16”x12” rectangle. Cut pastry in half lengthwise, forming two 16”x6” rectangles. Place 1 rectangle on prepared baking sheet. Leaving a 1-inch plain border, spoon filing onto pastry. Brush border with glaze. Top with second rectangle, pressing edges firmly to seal. Brush edges with glaze, then fold over, forming a ½ inch border on all four sides. Press border with tines of a fork to seal. Brush top of pastry with glaze, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of sugar. Using a sharp knife, cut 1½ inch diagonal slits down center of pastry at 2 inch intervals, exposing filling.
Bake pastry until golden grown, about 20-25 minutes. Cool pastry on sheet to lukewarm, about 45 minutes. Cut crosswise into 6 pieces and serve with vanilla ice cream.
