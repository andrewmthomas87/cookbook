Coconut Pavlovas with Tropical Fruit

6 servings

4	large egg whites
⅛	teaspoon cream of tartar
1	cup granulated sugar
1	teaspoon pure vanilla extract
⅓	cup unsweetened shredded coconut
4	large ripe passion fruits, halved
2	kiwis—peeled, halved lengthwise and sliced ¼ inch thick
1	small mango, peeled and thinly sliced

Preheat the oven to 275F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly spray it with cooking spray. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar at medium speed until frothy. Beat in the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the meringue is thick and glossy. Beat in the vanilla extract, then fold in the shredded coconut.
Scoop the meringue into six 3½-inch mounds on the prepared baking sheet. Using the back of a spoon, make a 1½-inch well in the center of each meringue.
Bake the meringues in the center of the oven for about 1 hour, until crisp and lightly golden but still chewy on the inside. Remove from the oven and let cool.
Scoop the pulp and seeds from the passion fruits into a bowl. Set the meringues on plates. Mound the kiwi and mango into the center of the meringues, spoon the passion fruit on top and serve..
