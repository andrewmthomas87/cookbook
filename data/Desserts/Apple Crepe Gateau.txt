Apple Crepe Gateau

6-8 Servings

¾	cup plus 2 tablespoons chestnut flour
½	cup wheat flour (scant)
1	to 1¼ cups milk
2	large eggs, beaten
7	tablespoons melted unsalted butter
12	apples, such as Golden Delicious
2	lemons, juiced or ¼ cup juice
¾	cup sugar
⅔	cup chestnut honey

In a large bowl combine chestnut flour, wheat flour, milk, eggs and 3 tablespoons of the melted butter and stir until thoroughly combined and smooth. Add more milk as needed to make a thin batter. Let rest, chilled, for 30 minutes.
Peel, core, and thinly slice apples. In a large bowl toss apples with lemon juice. In a very large skillet melt 3 tablespoons of the remaining butter over medium-high heat. Add the apples and sugar and cook until the apples are soft and caramelized, 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. (You may have to do this in batches.)
Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter. Heat a small skillet or crepe pan until hot and brush lightly with some of the melted butter. Pour crepe batter into skillet in ¼ cup amounts and swirl to evenly coat pan bottom. Cook until crepe is golden brown on bottom, 1 to 2 minutes, then flip with a spatula and cook until lightly browned on the second side, about 30 seconds. Transfer the crepe to a plate and cover to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter until all crepes are made.
Assemble the dessert by alternating layers of crepes with layers of the caramelized apples until all apples and crepes are used. Warm honey in a small saucepan and drizzle over the top of the crepe cake. Cut cake into wedges and serve warm, drizzled with any remaining honey.
