Peel, halve and core the pears. Cut pear halves into 4 wedges each. Arrange pears in circular pattern and around cake pan with tapered ends pointing inward. Place two small wedges in center.
Cake: Pulse the walnuts, flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a food processor until the walnuts are finely ground, 8 to 10 pulses. Transfer the walnut mixture to a bowl. Process the eggs and sugar until very pale yellow. With the food processor running, add the melted butter and oil in a steady stream until incorporated. Add the walnut mixture and pulse to combine, 4-5 pulses. Pour the batter evenly over the pear slices. Bake for 40 minutes, rotate pan, then bake until the cake bounces back when gently pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around the outside edge of the pan and invert onto a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and remove the parchment paper, Let the cake cool for about 2 hours before moving to a serving platter.  Cut into serving wedges and enjoy!
