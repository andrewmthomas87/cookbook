Citrus Sauce Dessert

6 Servings

1	orange
1	lemon
4	tablespoons sugar
2	tablespoons Cognac
1	tablespoon Cointreau or Triple-sec
Vanilla ice cream
Pound cake

Cut orange and lemon each in half then cut each half into quarters. Cut orange and lemon centers from each one-eighth piece just inside the pith, placing the meat into a food processor. Flatten each one-eighth piece of peel and cut off the pith, leaving a thin peel. Discard pith, then stack the peels and slice into julienne strips.
Create juice from the orange and lemon meat in the food processors by processing, then straining through a small sieve. Reserve the juice.
Place julienne peels into a small saucepan, cover with water, heat to a boil, and then simmer for 30 minutes or until most of the water has evaporated. Add 3 tablespoons of the sugar and stir. Cook over low heat until golden, about 10 minutes.
Add the reserved juice and remaining tablespoon of sugar. Cook over medium heat until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, add Cognac and Triple-sec.
Serve over vanilla ice cream or over pound cake with vanilla ice cream.
