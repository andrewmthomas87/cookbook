Chocolate Mousse

8-12 servings

8	ounces semi-sweet dark chocolate
4	eggs, separated
1	pint whipping cream (minus 1 ounce)
4	teaspoons sugar
2	teaspoons instant coffee

Mix the yolks and the sugar in the bowl you want your mousse to end in.
Melt the chocolate in a double boiler, making sure the water never gets to boil.
Meanwhile, beat the egg whites in a copper bowl until stiff. Beat the whipping cream in a separate copper bowl until stiff.
Add the melted chocolate to the yolks-sugar mix. Try to get them to mix as much as you can. Before the chocolate cools down completely, pour some whipping cream into the mix and stir with a wooden spoon. Then fold some egg whites into your mix. And so on. It is very important that you alternate, and be really gentle all along that process.
Let stand in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Spoon mousse in separate serving dishes and garnish with mint and red raspberries.
