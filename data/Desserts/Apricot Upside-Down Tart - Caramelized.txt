Apricot Upside-Down Tart - Caramelized

6 servings

½	to ¾ cup sugar
2	tablespoons water
3	tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons whipping cream
9	fresh apricots, halved, pitted, or
18	canned apricot halves in syrup (from three 15-ounce cans), drained
1	sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed half of a Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry package

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 425F. Combine ½ cup sugar if using canned apricots (or ¾ cup sugar if using fresh apricots) and 2 tablespoons water in a heavy small saucepan. Stir over medium low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber in color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with a pastry brush dipped into water, and swirling pan, about 8 minutes. Add butter and cream (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir over low heat until any caramel bits are dissolved. Immediately pour caramel into nonstick 10-inch ovenproof skillet; swirl to cover bottom of skillet. Carefully place apricot halves, rounded side down, tightly together atop caramel.
Roll out puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface to 12½-inch square. Using a 12-inch tart pan bottom or platter as a guide, cut pastry into a 12-inch round. Place puff pastry round atop the apricots in the skillet. Gently press down pastry around apricots at the edge of the skillet.
Bake the tart until the puff pastry is puffed and deep golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and cool 1 minute. Cut around edge of pastry to loosen. Place a large rimmed platter atop skillet, then using oven mitts, hold skillet and platter tightly together and invert, allowing tart and syrup to fall onto the platter. Carefully lift off the skillet. Rearrange any apricots that may have become dislodged, and serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
