Ricotta Budinos

4 servings

1	tablespoon confectioners' sugar
Pinch plus 1-tablespoon cinnamon
1	pound fresh ricotta
2	eggs, whole, plus 3 eggs, separated, whites beaten to stiff peaks
1	tablespoon all-purpose flour
1¼	cup sugar
1	orange peel, julienned and candied*
2	tablespoons high-quality brandy
½	lemon, zested

Preheat the oven to 350F.
In a small bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar with a pinch of cinnamon and set aside. Grease and flour four 3 inch ramekins and set aside.
In a medium-sized bowl, combine the ricotta with the remaining cinnamon and add the 2 eggs, 3 yolks, flour, sugar, brandy and lemon zest. Mix well to combine. Fold in the beaten egg whites.
Turn the mixture into the ramekins, filling them to ⅔ capacity, and bake in the oven for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave to rest in the oven 6 minutes. Remove from the oven, dust with the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon mixture, and serve with the orange julienne distributed on top of each serving.
*Quarter the orange, remove the pulp and julienne the peel finely. Combine 1 cup of sugar with 1½ cup of water. Bring to a boil, making sure all the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the orange julienne, adding enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then remove the orange julienne, rinse in cold water, and return to the pan. Repeat this process 2 more times, then simmer until the orange julienne is translucent and tender.
