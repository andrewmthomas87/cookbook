Sopapillas

4-6 servings

1	cup flour
½	teaspoon salt
1	teaspoon baking powder
1	tablespoons sugar
½	tablespoons shortening
5	tablespoons milk
Oil for frying

Sift flour with salt, baking powder and sugar. Cut in shortening. Add milk to make a firm dough.
Cover bowl and let dough stand for 45 to 60 minutes.
Roll dough about ¼ inch thick on lightly floured board. Cut into diamonds, or rounds.
Heat oil in electric skillet to 375F. Fry only a few pieces at a time, turning once so they will puff up very easily. Drain on paper towel and keep warm in oven until all are cooked.
Sprinkle with cinnamon and serve with honey; or drizzle with chocolate sauce and sprinkle with powdered sugar.
