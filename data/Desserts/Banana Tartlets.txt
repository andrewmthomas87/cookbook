Prepare pastry: Roll out dough according to package directions. Cut out eight 5-inch discs. Place on parchment-lined baking sheet*. Using a sharp paring knife, score a circle on the inside of each disk to create ½-inch rims. Prick centers with a fork. Chill for one hour.
Prepare frangipane: In an electric mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar, egg, and yolk. Add almonds and flour and continue beating until smooth. Set aside.
Assemble tartlets: Spoon about 3 tablespoons of the frangipane into the middle of each pastry disk, leaving rims clear. Place in an overlapping ring of banana slices on top of the frangipane. Brush with melted butter and dust lightly with confectioners’ sugar. Bake in a preheated 350F oven until the bananas are caramelized and pastry is golden, about 30 minutes. Serve warm
* An insulated baking sheet will prevent bottoms of the pastry from overcooking.
