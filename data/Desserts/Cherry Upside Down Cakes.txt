2 servings

¼	cup (½ stick).unsalted butter-room temperature
½	cup plus 1½ tablespoon packed light brown sugar
1½	cups drained sour cherries (reserve 1 teaspoon juice)
⅓	cup all-purpose flour
¼	cup almonds, toasted
¼	cup unsweetened cocoa powder
¼	teaspoon baking powder
¼	teaspoon coarse salt
1	large egg yolk
3	tablespoons whole milk
¼	cup heavy cream
2	teaspoons rum

Preheat oven to 350F. Place 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and ½ teaspoon cherry juice in the bottom of each of two 8-ounce ramekins. Microwave ramekins until buter and brown sugar are melted and bubbling, about 1 minute. Arrange cherries in a tightly packed layer in the bottom of each ramekin.
In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt. In another small bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons butter and ⅓ cup brown sugar with a wooden spoon until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Stir in the egg yolk, then the flour mixture and milk. Divide batter between the ramekins.
Place ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, beat the cream, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and the rum until soft peaks form. Run a paring knife around the edge of each cake and invert onto a plate. Serve the cakes with the rum whipped cream.
