¼	teaspoon salt

6	tablespoons butter
1	cup (or more) whole milk

For crepes: Blend first 3 ingredients in processor. Blend in eggs, 2 tablespoons melted butter, then 1 cup milk until smooth, scraping down sides often. Transfer batter to bowl. Cover; chill 1 hour. If necessary, whisk more milk into batter, 1 tablespoonful at a time, to thin to consistency of very heavy cream. Heat heavy nonstick skillet with 7-inch diameter bottom over medium-high heat. Brush skillet with melted butter. Spoon 2½ tablespoons batter into skillet; swirl to coat bottom evenly. Cook until top of crepe appears dry, about 45 seconds. Loosen sides of crepe with spatula. Turn crepe over; cook until brown spots appear on bottom, about 30 seconds. Turn crepe out onto plate. Repeat with remaining batter, stacking crepes between sheets of waxed paper. (Can be made 3 days ahead; place in resealable plastic bag and chill.)
For filling: Whisk eggs and sugar in medium bowl until very thick and pale yellow. Bring lemon juice and lemon peel to boil in heavy small saucepan. Gradually whisk hot juice mixture into egg mixture. Return mixture to same pan; stir over medium heat until curd boils, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time, until melted. Press plastic wrap onto surface of curd; chill until cold, at least 2 hours. Beat cream to peaks in bowl; fold into curd in 2 additions. Cover; chill at least 6 hours. Place 1 crepe, spotted side up, on work surface. Spread ¼ cup filling over half of crepe. Fold crepe in half, then in half again, creating triangle. Repeat with 11 more crepes and remaining filling. Place 2 crepes on each plate; scoop sorbet alongside. Sift powdered sugar over.
