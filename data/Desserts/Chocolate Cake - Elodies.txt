Elodie’s Chocolate Cake

8-10 pieces

10	ounces bittersweet (not unsweetened) dark chocolate, chopped
1	cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
5	large eggs
1¼	cups sugar
1½	teaspoons baking powder
5	tablespoons all purpose flour
Powdered sugar

Preheat the oven to 325F. Butter and flour a 10 inch–diameter springform pan with 2½ inch high sides. Stir chocolate and butter in a heavy medium saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Let this mixture cool a bit while you beat the eggs and sugar in a large bowl until well blended and beginning to thicken. Sift flour and baking powder over eggs and whisk until completely blended. Gradually fold in the warm chocolate mixture, and then transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake cake for 30 minutes uncovered, then cover loosely pan with foil and bake until a toothpick  inserted into center comes out with a few moist crumbs still attached, about 40-45 minutes longer. Uncover the cake, cool briefly in the pan on a rack (cake will fall as it cools). Sift powdered sugar over cake. Cut around pan sides with a thin knife to loosen cake, then release and remove pan sides. Cut into wedges and serve with vanilla and coffee ice cream. You can prepare the cake mix and let it set in the pan up to an hour or so before dinner, then put it in the pre-heated oven so it will come out about ten minutes before serving. That way the center of the cake should still be warm and moist when it is served.
