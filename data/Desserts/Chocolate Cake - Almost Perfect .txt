Chocolate Cake – Almost Perfect

12 pieces

12	ounces bittersweet (not unsweetened) dark chocolate, chopped
11	tablespoons (almost 1½ sticks) unsalted butter
¾	cup sugar
5	large eggs
5	tablespoons all purpose flower
Glaze recipe

Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter a 9 inch–diameter springform pan with 2½ inch high sides. Stir chocolate, butter, and sugar in a heavy medium saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. After cooling, whisk egg yolks into the chocolate. Whisk in flour.
Beat egg whites until they form firm peaks. Vigorously mix one-third of the egg whites into the chocolate batter. Gently and thoroughly fold in the remaining egg whites.
Pour batter into the springform pan. Bake until the cake is firm and springy, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool completely on a rack, and then cut around outside edge with a thin knife before releasing the cake from the springform pan and inverting it on a platter.
Slide a few strips of was paper under the edges of the cake to catch drips. Pour all the warm glaze into a big puddle on top of the cake. Use the back of a rubber spatula to nudge the glaze toward the edges where it can drip down the ides. Let set a few minutes, then pull away the wax paper strips.
Glaze: Chop 4 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate and tumble it into a medium bowl. Heat ¼ cup heavy cream to boiling. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Cover with a plate and let stand 5 minutes. With a rubber spatula, gently stir smooth. Sir in 1 teaspoon cognac.
