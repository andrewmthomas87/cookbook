Pears with Chocolate

6 servings

Butter, for greasing
6	Bosc or other firm pears, peeled
¼	cup honey
Pinch cinnamon
5	ounces semisweet chocolate
2	eggs (whites only)
1	tablespoon confectioners' sugar milk

Preheat the oven to 375F.
Using the butter, grease an ovenproof casserole. Cut a slice off the bottom of each pear to make it stand upright, and then place them in the casserole. Add ½ cup water and place the pears in the oven to soften for 40 minutes, basting 3 to 4 times throughout the process.
Combine the pan juices with the honey and cinnamon in a small bowl and whisk together until it's the consistency of a light emulsion. Augment with hot tap water if necessary. Drizzle the pears with this mixture, return the pears to the oven, and let cook for another 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside until ready to serve.
In the top part of a double boiler, melt the chocolate, stirring constantly to avoid scorching. Set aside to cool.
Separate the 2 eggs and discard the yolks. Beat the egg whites and confectioners' sugar together, to form stiff peaks, and then, fold this mixture into the chocolate mixture.
Place 1 pear on each of 6 dessert plates and top with some of the chocolate mixture. Serve immediately.
