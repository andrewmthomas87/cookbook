Pears – Poached in Spiced Red Wine Syrup with Mascarpone

4 servings

2	Bosc pears, not too ripe
2½	cups red wine, such as pinot noir
1	cup sugar
½	cup water
½	cinnamon stick
1	star anise
2	black peppercorns
1	two-inch piece orange peel
2	thin slices ginger
1	cup mascarpone
4	tablespoons powdered sugar
1	small egg yolk

Peel the pears with a vegetable peeler. Halve vertically and with a melon baller or a small scoop, remove the core and the filament that lines the inside of the pear.
In a small pot over medium heat, bring the red wine, sugar, water, spices, orange peel and ginger to a simmer, and add the pear halves. Cover pears with a piece of parchment paper and turn heat to medium low. Simmer 15-20 minutes, or until pears can be easily pierced with the tip of a paring knife. Remove pears to a plate with a slotted spoon and turn heat to high. Reduce liquid by three-quarters or until syrupy but not caramelized. Cool to room temperature.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl with a wooden spoon, beat together the mascarpone, powdered sugar and egg yolk until smooth.
Carefully toss pears in syrup to coat well. Fill core with the mascarpone and drizzle with some of the additional syrup.
