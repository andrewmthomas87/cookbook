Banana Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting

one 9x13 inch cake

For the cake:
1½	cups mashed ripe bananas
2	teaspoons lemon juice
3	cups flour
1½	teaspoons baking soda
¼	teaspoon salt
¾	cup butter
2	cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar
3	eggs
2	teaspoons vanilla
1½	cups buttermilk
For the frosting:
1	eight ounce package cream cheese
½	cup butter, softened
1	teaspoon vanilla
3½	cups powdered sugar
Chopped walnuts

For the cake:
Preheat the oven to 275F.
In a small bowl, combine the mashed bananas with the lemon juice and set aside. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside. Cream together the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy, then beat in the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla then beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Fold in the mashed banana mixture and pour into a 9×13‑inch greased pan.
Bake the cake for one hour, or until a toothpick when inserted comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven when done cooking and immediately transfer to the freezer for 45 minutes to cool (this will make the cake extra moist).
Remove the cake from the freezer, frost with cream cheese frosting (recipe below) and top with chopped walnuts.
For the cream cheese frosting:
Beat together the cream cheese and softened butter until well incorporated. Beat in vanilla then slowly beat in the powdered sugar until the icing is smooth in texture. Spread on prepared cake and serve.
