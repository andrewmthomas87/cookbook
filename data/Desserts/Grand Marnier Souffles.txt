Grand Marnier Soufflés

4-6 servings

½	cup milk, scalded
1½	tablespoons flour
2	tablespoons butter, plus extra for the ramekins
4	tablespoons sugar, plus extra for the ramekins
5	egg yolks
Grated rind of 1 orange
4	tablespoons Grand Marnier
6	egg whites

Heat oven to 400F. Butter and sugar four to six ramekins, then refrigerate. Just before using, prepare with a 4 inch aluminum foil collar, buttered on the inside.
In a small saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring, until mixture begins to turn golden. Add scalded milk and continue stirring until a thick sauce forms. Cook another 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with 3 tablespoons of sugar. Combine with the sauce and mix well, then stir in the grated orange rind and the Grand Marnier. Set aside. (Soufflé base can be made in advance and kept in the refrigerator covered tightly with plastic film).
Beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Sprinkle on the remaining tablespoon of sugar and continue beating until the whites are stiff, but not dry.
Stir about a quarter of the beaten egg whites into the sauce to lighten it, and then rapidly fold the remaining egg whites into the mixture. Transfer the batter to the chilled ramekins inside the aluminum foil collars, set on a cookie sheet and place in the lower one third of the oven. Bake for 12 minutes, then check to see if the soufflés are rising. If not, rotate the ramekins ½ turn and continue baking another 6 to 8 minutes until top is browned. Remove collars, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve immediately.
