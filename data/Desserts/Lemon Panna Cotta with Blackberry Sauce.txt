6 servings

Panna Cotta:
Vegetable Oil
1	cup whole milk
1	cup whipping cream
½	teaspoon vanilla extract
5	tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2	teaspoons unflavored gelatin
1	cup crème fraiche
2	tablespoons grated lemon peel
Sauce:
3	cups fresh or frozen blackberries
3	tablespoons brown sugar
3	tablespoons crème de cassis
6	sprigs of fresh mint leaves

Panna Cotta: Lightly oil six ¾-cup ramekins or custard cups. Mix milk and cream in a heavy medium saucepan. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean and add to milk. Bring to simmer, then remove from heat, cover, and let steep for 30 minutes. Remove vanilla bean.
Pour lemon juice into a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over and let stand until gelatin softens, about 10 minutes. Stir sugar and gelatin mixture into mixture. Stir over low heat just until sugar and gelatin dissolve, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in crème fraiche and grated lemon peel. Divide among ramekins, filling to just below top. Cover, chill until set, at least 6 hours or overnight in refrigerator.
Sauce: Set aside 12 intact blackberries for later use. Puree the remaining blackberries and all reserved juices, brown sugar, and liquor in a blender or food processor. Strain mixture through sieve into a medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids in strainer. Stir reserved blackberries into the sauce. (Can be made 1 day ahead and kept covered in refrigerator.)
To serve, run a small thin knife around each panna cotta. Place bottoms of ramekins, one at a time, in a bowl of boiling water for 45 seconds. Hold plate and ramekin together, invert, shaking gently to turn out panna cotta. Spoon blackberry sauce around each panna cotta, add two of the whole blackberries and a sprig of mint and serve immediately.
