Apple-Raisin Crisp

8 servings

Crumb Topping
1	cup all purpose flour
¾	cup dark brown sugar
1	teaspoon cinnamon
¼	teaspoon nutmeg
1	stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter
Apples & Raisins
½	cup raisins, soaked for 30 minutes 		in port or cream sherry
3	tablespoons unsalted butter
2½	pounds Granny Smith apples, peeled, 		cored & cut into ½-inch slices
2	tablespoons sugar
1	teaspoon ground cinnamon
3	tablespoons lemon juice
1	tablespoon vanilla

Preheat the oven to 400F. Cover the raisins with port or cream sherry and let stand until plump (about 30 minutes). Generously butter a 3 quart soufflé dish.
Melt the 3 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet. Stir in the apples and coat with the butter. Add the lemon juice, sugar, and vanilla. Sprinkle with the cinnamon and cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until the apples absorb most of the liquid, 5-10 minutes. Drain the raisins; stir in the apples. Spoon into the prepared soufflé dish and smooth to an even layer.
In a food processor, pulse the flour with the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add the butter and process until the mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle evenly over the apples. Bake until the top is well browned and crisp, about 30-35 minutes. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream
