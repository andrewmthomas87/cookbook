Creamy Cheese Blintzes

30 blintzes

Crepe Ingredients:
1	cup plus 2 tablespoons sifted		 all-purpose flour
¼	cup sugar
¼	teaspoon salt
1½	cups milk
2	tablespoons (¼ stick) butter
Filing Ingredients:
24	ounces cottage cheese
¾	cup sugar
1	egg
1	egg yolk
1½	teaspoons vanilla
1½	teaspoons orange water
Melted utter
Powdered sugar
Sour Cream

For the Crepes: Sift first three ingredients into a bowl. Add 1 ½ cups milk, eggs and 1 tablespoon of butter; whisk until smooth. Heat a 6-inch diameter crepe pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Brush lightly with some of the remaining melted butter. Working quickly, ladle scant ¼ cup of the batter into the pan, tilting so the batter just coats the bottom. Immediately return excess batter to the bowl. Cook crepe until the bottom is brown, about 2 minutes. Loosen edges with a spatula and slide crepe out onto a plate and cover with waxed paper (do not cook the second side). Repeat with remaining batter, stirring occasionally. (If batter becomes thick, thin with a little additional milk.) Adjust heat and brush pan with butter as necessary. (Crepes can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
For the Filling: Line a colander with 2 layers of dampened cheesecloth. Place over bowl. Transfer cottage cheese to the colander. Cover with cheesecloth, then plastic wrap. Place heavy object over the cheese and let stand 3 hours to drain. Transfer cottage cheese to a large bowl. Add ¾ cup of sugar, the egg, yolk, vanilla, and orange flower water and whisk until well blended.
Place 1 crepe cooked side down on the work surface. Place 1 rounded tablespoon of the filling in the center of the crepe and fold half of the crepe over the filling. Fold in sides, then roll up, enclosing the filling completely. Repeat with remaining crepes and filling. (Blintzes can be prepared 1 week ahead. Cover and freeze. Thaw in refrigerator before continuing.)
