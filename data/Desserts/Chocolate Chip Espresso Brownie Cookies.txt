Chocolate Chip Espresso Brownie Cookies

about 1 dozen cookies

3	ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
2	cups semisweet chocolate chips
8	tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, diced
3	 large eggs
1	cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
2	teaspoons instant coffee granules
¾	cup all-purpose flour
⅓	teaspoon baking powder
¼	teaspoon salt

Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
In a double boiler, combine the unsweetened chocolate, 1 cup of chocolate chips and butter, stirring until melted. Remove the smaller pan containing the chocolate from the double boiler and set it aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs, sugar and instant coffee granules on high speed until very thick and mixture forms a ribbon when whisk is lifted, about 3 minutes.
Slowly add the chocolate mixture to the bowl, whisking just until combined.
Turn off the stand mixer. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into the bowl and stir just until combined. Stir in the remaining 1 cup of chocolate chips.
Portion heaping tablespoons of batter about 2 inches apart on a parchment- or Silpat-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are cracked and puffed on top. Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and allow the cookies to cool for 1 minute on the baking sheet before transferring them to a cooling rack.
