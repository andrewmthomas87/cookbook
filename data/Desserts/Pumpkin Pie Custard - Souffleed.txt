Pumpkin Pie Custard - Souffléd

6 servings

1	orange
2	eggs, separated
1	can (15 ounces) solid pack pumpkin
⅔	cup low-fat milk
2	tablespoons maple syrup
1	teaspoon ground cinnamon
½	teaspoon ground ginger
⅛	teaspoon each: ground cloves, salt
1	teaspoon confectioners sugar

Heat oven to 350F. Grate the zest from half of the orange with a fine grater into a large bowl. Cut orange in half; juice the whole orange. Add juice to bowl. Add the egg yolks, pumpkin, milk, maple syrup, cinnamon, ginger and cloves. Beat with electric mixer until smooth, 1 minute. Beat the egg whites in another bowl until stiff, about 2 minutes; fold into the pumpkin mixture. Divide among six 6-ounce ramekins.
Place the ramekins in a roasting pan; pour boiling water into the pan until it reaches at least halfway up the sides of the custard cups. Bake until lightly set, about 25 minutes. Serve warm, sprinkled with confectioners' sugar.
