Pound Cake

12 servings

2	cups unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more to grease the pans
3	cups granulated sugar
6 	large eggs, at room temperature
2	teaspoons vanilla extract
1	teaspoon salt
3	cups) cake flour
¼	cup whipping cream

Preheat oven to 325°F.
Generously butter and flour one 12-cup Bundt pan or two 8½ inch-by-4½ inch loaf pans, and set aside.
Using an electric mixer or by hand, cream together the remaining butter and sugar. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla and salt.
Gently stir in the flour by hand, adding it very gradually; this will help to keep the cake tender. Add the cream and stir just until thoroughly combined.
Pour the batter into the pan or pans and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes; then turn the cake out onto a rack to cool completely.
