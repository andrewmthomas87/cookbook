Meyer Lemon Budino

6 servings

½	cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
3	large eggs, separated
¼	cup all purpose flour
¼	cup fresh Meyer lemon juice (or lime juice)
2	tablespoons fresh regular lemon juice
2	tablespoons finely grated Meyer lemon peel (or lime)
¾	cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk
¼	teaspoon salt
1	cup whipped cream

Preheat oven to 350F. Butter six ¾ cup ramekins. Combine ½ cup sugar, egg yolks, flour, lemon juice, and zest in a large bowl; whisk until well blended, then whisk in milk.
Beat egg whites and salt in a medium bowl until frothy. Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the sugar and beat until soft peaks form. Fold beaten egg whites into lemon mixture in 2 additions. Divide mixture among the prepared ramekins. Place ramekins in a roasting pan and pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake the puddings until the tops are golden and they spring back when lightly touched, about 30 minutes. Remove cups from water and serve warm or cold with whipped cream
