Raspberries with Saba Sabayon

4 servings

4	large egg yolks
¼	cup powdered sugar
4	tablespoon saba (spiced rum)
2	tablespoons water
½	cup chilled whipping cream
12	ounces fresh raspberries

Whisk egg yolks, sugar, saba, and 2 tablespoons water to blend in top of a double boiler over barely simmering water (do not allow the upper pot to touch the water); whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and thermometer registers 160F, about 4 minutes. Place the top of the double boiler over a large bowl filled with ice and continue whisking until mixture cools, about 3 minutes. Whip cream in a small bowl until soft peaks form; fold into the saba mixture. Cover the sabayon with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.
Divide raspberries among dessert cups. Spoon sabayon over and serve.
