½	pound butter, melted (2 sticks-227 grams)
1½	cups sugar (375 ml)
1	cup water (250 ml)
juice of ½ lemon

Make simple syrup. In a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, add water, sugar and lemon juice. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil. Let simmer to a syrupy consistency. Remove from heat, let cool and add rosewater or vanilla or honey.
Preheat oven to 350F. Butter a 12-inch round, 2-inch high cake pan.
In a large bowl gently loosen kataifi. Mix very well with the ½ pound of melted butter. Place blanched almonds in a decorative pattern in the cake pan. Cover with half of the kataifi. Press down lightly.
Spread the ricotta in an even layer over kataifi, and then cover with the remaining half of the kataifi. Press down gently. Cover with foil. Bake 35 minutes covered, then uncover and broil for 5-10 minutes until lightly golden.
Immediately pour cooled sugar syrup evenly over the hot kunafa. Let cool completely to room temperature. Invert onto serving plate and serve warm.
