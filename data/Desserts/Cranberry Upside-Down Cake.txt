Cranberry Upside-Down Cake

12-16 servings

Topping:
1	stick unsalted butter
½	cup brown sugar
2	teaspoons water
½	teaspoon ground cinnamon
½	teaspoon ground allspice
4	cups cranberries, rinsed
Cake:
1½	cups sifted flour
2	teaspoons baking powder
½	teaspoon salt
8	ounces unsalted butter
½	cup granulated sugar
2	large eggs
1	cup milk
1	teaspoon vanilla

Heat oven to 350F. For topping, melt butter in a medium saucepan; add sugar, cinnamon, and allspice. Cook, stirring until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Stir in cranberries. Pour into a greased 9-inch springform pan with outside wrapped in foil to prevent leakage; set aside.
For cake, sift flour, baking soda, and salt into a bowl and set aside. Beat butter and sugars with mixer on medium speed until smooth and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add half of the flour mixture, mixing until combined. Add milk and vanilla, mixing until combined. Add remaining flour mixture, mixing until smooth. Transfer batter to springform pan, spreading evenly over the cranberry mixture. Bake until golden brown, edges are just beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan, and a toothpick comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let cool on rack for 10 minutes. Run a knife around edge to loosen cake, then, working over the sink, carefully invert onto plate. Be careful, because some of the liquid will spill out around the edges. Remove foil, ring, and pan bottom. Replace any cranberries that fall from the edges. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
