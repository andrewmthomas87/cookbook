Cream Cheese Pound Cake

8-12 servings

1	cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1	eight-ounce package cream cheese, room temperature
3	cups sugar
1	teaspoon salt
6	large eggs, room temperature
4	teaspoons vanilla extract
3	cups sifted all purpose flour

Butter and flour a 12-cup bundt pan. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and cream cheese in a large bowl until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add sugar and salt, and then beat for 10 minutes, occasionally scraping sides of bowl. Add eggs one at a time, beating until blended after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Beat in flour at low speed until the batter is smooth (do not over beat). Transfer to bundt pan.
Place pan in cold oven. Set temperature to 200F; bake 20 minutes. Increase temperature to 250F and bake 20 minutes more. Increase temperature to 275F and bake for 10 minutes. Increase temperature to 300F and bake about 1 hour longer, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool cake in the pan on a rack for 15 minutes. Turn cake out onto the rack and cool completely before serving. Can be made 3 days in advance and stored wrapped or covered at room temperature.
