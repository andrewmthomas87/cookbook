Lemon Cookies

About 30 cookies

1¼	cups all-purpose flour
1/3	cup cornstarch
1½	teaspoons baking powder
¼	teaspoon salt
¾	cup sugar, divided
2	tablespoons butter, softened
2	tablespoons canola oil
1	large egg white
1½	teaspoons freshly grated lemon zest
1	teaspoon vanilla extract
3	tablespoons lemon juice

Preheat oven to 350F. Coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.
Whisk flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. Beat ½ cup sugar, butter and oil in another mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add egg white, lemon zest and vanilla; beat until smooth. Beat in lemon juice. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and fold in with a rubber spatula just until combined.
Drop the dough by teaspoonfuls, 2 inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheets. Place the remaining ¼ cup sugar in a saucer. Coat the bottom of a wide-bottomed glass with cooking spray and dip it in the sugar. Flatten the dough with the glass into 2½ -inch circles, dipping the glass in the sugar each time.
Bake the cookies until they are just starting to brown around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a flat surface (not a rack) to crisp.
