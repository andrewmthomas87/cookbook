Apple Tart

10-12 servings

Pastry
2	cups all purpose flour
1½	sticks) cold butter, diced
1	tablespoons sugar
½	cup ice water
Apples
4 Granny Smith apples
½	cup sugar
4	tablespoons butter
⅓	cup apple jelly
2	tablespoons Calvados or rum

Preheat oven to 400F.
For the pastry, place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse for a few seconds to combine. Add the butter and pulse 10 to 12 times, until the butter is in small bits the size of peas. With the motor running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse just until the dough starts to come together. Dump onto a floured board and knead quickly into a ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Roll the dough slightly larger than a round tart pan. Place the dough on the prepared tart pan and refrigerate while you prepare the apples.
Peel the apples and cut them in half through the stem. Remove the stems and cores with a sharp knife and a melon baler. Slice the apples crosswise in ¼ inch thick slices. Place overlapping slices of apples in a pattern until the pastry is covered with apple slices. Sprinkle with the full ½ cup of sugar and dot with the butter.
Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the pastry is browned and the edges of the apples start to brown. Rotate the pan once during cooking. If the pastry puffs up in one area, cut a little slit with a knife to let the air out. When the tart is done, heat the apricot jelly together with the Calvados or rum and brush the apples and the pastry completely with the jelly mixture. Allow to cool and serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream.
