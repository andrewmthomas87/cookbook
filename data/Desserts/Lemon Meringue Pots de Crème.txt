Lemon Meringue Pots de Crème

6 servings

2	cups half-and-half
4	large eggs, separated
¾	cup sugar, plus 4 tablespoons
3	tablespoons cornstarch
Pinch of salt
2	tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
2	teaspoons lemon zest
½	cup lemon juice
1	tablespoon finely chopped pistachios

Heat half-and-half to just under a boil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan or a double boiler. In a mixing bowl, combine egg yolks, ¾ cup sugar, cornstarch and salt. Whisk well until creamy, a minute or two.
Slowly whisk ½ cup of hot half-and-half into egg-sugar mixture, then add remaining half-and-half and mix well. Pour back into saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking continuously, until custard is thick, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter, lemon zest and lemon juice. Spoon custard into 6 four-ounce ramekins. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, and up to several hours. (May be done even a day ahead.)
Combine chopped pistachios with 1 tablespoon sugar. Heat oven to 350F. Put egg whites in mixing bowl and add 3 remaining tablespoons sugar. Beat whites to stiff peaks. Spoon a pile of meringue onto each custard-filled ramekin, using all the meringue. Sprinkle with pistachio-sugar mixture. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the tops are browned. (May be baked just before guests arrive, then kept at room temperature until time for dessert.)
