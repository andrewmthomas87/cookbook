Chocolate Mocha Budino

About 6 servings

6	ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
2	tablespoons finely ground expresso coffee
12	tablespoons (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, cut into bits
¾	cup sugar
2	tablespoons flour
1	pinch fine sea salt
3	large eggs, separated,at room temperature
1	teaspoon vanilla
⅛	teaspoon cream of tartar
1	pint coffee ice cream or vanilla ice cream

Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat to 375F. Butter 6 ramekins.
Melt the chocolate and butter with the espresso coffee, all but 6 tablespoons of sugar and the salt in a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Whisk in the egg yolks, flour, and vanilla.
In a medium bowl combine the egg whites and cream of tartar. Using a hand-held electric mixer on high speed, beat until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons of sugar gradually, beating constantly, until the whites are stiff and glossy.
Fold ¼ of the beaten whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Scrape the chocolate mixture into the bowl of whites and fold just until combined. Divide the batter evenly among 6 8- to 12-ounce (or so) oven-proof ramekins (the batter may not fill the ramekin, but will leave enough room for ice cream). Place the ramekins on a large baking sheet and fill with water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
Bake until the budinos are puffed with crusty, deeply cracked tops and a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out gooey, 40 to 45 minutes.
