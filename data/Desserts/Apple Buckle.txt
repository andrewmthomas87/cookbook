10-12 servings

Crumb Topping
1½	cups all purpose flour
¾	cup dark brown sugar
1	teaspoon cinnamon
1	teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
pinch of salt
1	stick (4 ounces) butter, softened
½	cup coarsely chopped walnuts
	Batter
2	cups all-purpose flour
2	teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon ground ginger
¼	teaspoon salt
1½	sticks unsalted butter, softened
½	cup sugar
¼	cup honey
1	teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1	teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2	large eggs
½	cup half & half
2	pounds Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored & cut into ½-inch dice

Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter and flour a 10-inch springform pan.
Make the Crumb Topping: In a food processor, pulse the flour with the brown sugar, cinnamon, lemon zest, and salt. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles moist sand. Add the walnuts and pulse 3 times. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and press into large crumbs.
Make the Batter: In a medium bowl, whisk the flour with the baking powder, ginger, and salt. In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer, beat the butter until creamy. Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the honey. Add the lemon zest, vanilla, and eggs and beat until smooth. Add the dry ingredients in 2 batches, alternating with the half & half and beat at low speed until smooth. Fold in the diced apples and distribute evenly in batter.
Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle evenly with the crumb topping. Bake the buckle in the center of the oven for 1 hour an 15 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool for at least 1 hour before unhinging the springform pan and removing the ring. Cut the buckle into wedges and serve with vanilla ice cream.
