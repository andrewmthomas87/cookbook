Chocolate Soufflés - Double

4 servings in 4.5 inch ramekins, 6 servings in 4 inch ramekins, and 8 servings in 3.5 inch ramekins 8 servings in small ramekins or 6 servings in medium ramekins

2	tablespoons butter
2	tablespoons all purpose flour
1	cup whole milk
9	ounces unsweetened dark chocolate, chopped
6	tablespoons sugar, divided
4	large eggs, separated
¼	teaspoon salt for the egg whites

Butter the small soufflé ramekins, then lightly dust the insides with sugar. Surround each mold with a 6 inch tall buttered aluminum foil collar. Place the molds on a baking sheet and set aside.
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of flour; whisk until the roux mixture is bubbling, about 1 minute. Increase heat to medium high and gradually whisk in 1 cup of milk. Cook until the mixture boils and begins to thicken, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and 4 tablespoons of the sugar; whisk until melted and smooth. Pour soufflé base into a large bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. (The base can be prepared in advance and refrigerated for up to 2 days.)
Separate the four eggs, then whisk the egg yolks into the soufflé base. Using an electric mixer beat the egg whites and salt in a medium copper bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar, beating until stiff and glossy. Fold ¼ of the whites into the soufflé base to thin. Fold in remaining egg whites in 2 additions. Divide the soufflé mixture among the prepared ramekins.
Preheat the oven to 400F. Bake the soufflés uncovered on a rimmed baking sheet until puffed and centers move slightly when baking sheet is shaken gently, about 25 minutes.
Sprinkle powdered sugar over the soufflés, then remove the aluminum foil collars and serve immediately.
