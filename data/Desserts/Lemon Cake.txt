Lemon Cake

6-8 serving

Cake Ingredients:
1	 pound unsalted butter, at room temperature
2½	cups granulated sugar
4 	extra-large eggs, at room temperature
⅓	cup grated lemon zest (6 to 8 large lemons)
3	cups all-purpose flour
½	teaspoon baking powder
½	teaspoon baking soda
1	teaspoon kosher salt
¾	cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
¾	cup buttermilk, at room temperature
1	teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Glaze Ingredients:
2	cups confectioners’ sugar
3½	tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

Make the Cake: Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease two 8½ -by-4½	by-2½ inch loaf pans.
Cream the butter and 2 cups granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy. With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs, one at a time, and the lemon zest.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. In another bowl, combine ¼ cup lemon juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla. Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour. Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.
Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar with ½ cup lemon juice in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves and makes a syrup. When the cakes are done, let them cool for 10 minutes, then invert them onto a rack set over a tray. Turn the cakes right-side up and spoon the lemon syrup generously over the mounded tops, allowing the syrup to dribble down the sides. Let the cakes sit to cool completely.
Make the glaze: Combine the confectioners’ sugar and lemon juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth. Pour over the top of the cakes and allow the glaze to drizzle down the sides.
