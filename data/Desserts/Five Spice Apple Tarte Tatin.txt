Five Spice Apple Tarte Tatin

8 servings

4	tablespoons plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1	cup sugar
4	Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and quartered, acidulated in 1 tablespoon lime juice
½	tablespoon five-spice powder
1	sheet of ready made puff pastry dough, defrosted
1	large egg combined with 2 tablespoons of water
½	cup pecans, chopped
½	cup cranberries, roughly chopped
8	mint sprigs to garnish

Preheat the oven to 375F convection or 400F conventional
In a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat, melt 4 tablespoons of butter and add the sugar. Caramelize the sugar in the butter, about 4 minutes. Drop the heat to low and add the apple slices, round side down and dust the tops of the quarters with the five-spice powder. Continue to cook until slightly softened about 3-4 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut the puff pastry in a 10-inch-inch circle. Dock the dough, making holes in it using the tines of a fork. Using a rolling pin, roll one edge of the dough onto the rolling pin and carefully transfer it on top of the apples, rolling it off. Brush the dough with egg wash.
Bake 20-25 minutes until the puff pastry is golden brown and is cooked throughout, and the apples are soft. Remove from the oven and while still hot, carefully invert onto a serving platter.
While the tarte bakes, in a small sauté pan, melt the remaining butter and sauté the pecans and cranberries for about 2 minutes. Reserve.
7. To plate – Using a sharp knife, cut the tarte into eight wedges. Plate a piece and add a either a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of ice cream and the sautéed pecans and cranberries. Garnish with a mint sprig.
