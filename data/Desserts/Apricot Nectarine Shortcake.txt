Apricot Nectarine Shortcake

8 servings

Shortcake Ingredients:
2	cups all-purpose flour
2	tablespoons sugar, plus 2 tablespoons for sprinkling
1	tablespoon baking powder
Pinch salt
1	stick unsalted butter, chilled, cut into pea-size pieces
½	cup heavy cream
Fruit Ingredients:
¼	cup unsalted butter
5	apricots, pitted, cut into sixths
5	nectarines, pitted, cut into sixths
2	tablespoons sugar

Shortcakes: Preheat the oven to 425F0. In the food processor combine the flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like grated Parmesan cheese. Add the cream and pulse until the mixture looks very crumbly but sticks together.
Remove the blade from the processor and form craggy looking dough balls about the size of a small tennis ball. Put the dough balls on a baking sheet lined with a silpat or parchment paper. Sprinkle each ball with a little sugar. Bake in the preheated oven for about 11 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.
Fruit: Add the butter to a saute pan and melt it over medium heat. Add the fruit and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle in the sugar and saute for another 2 to 3 minutes.
