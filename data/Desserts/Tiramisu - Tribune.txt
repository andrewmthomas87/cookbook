Tiramisu - Tribune

12 servings

6	eggs, separated, whites reserved
½	cup sugar
1	pound mascarpone cheese, softened
1	container (1/2 pint) whipping cream
2	cups espresso at room temperature
2	to 4 tablespoons dark rum
⅔ package (17 ounces) Italian ladyfingers
12	ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped

Have ready a 13-by-9-inch deep serving dish or 12 individual 10-ounce serving dishes.
Heat a small pan of water to simmer over medium heat. Combine egg yolks and ¼ cup of the sugar in a bowl fitted over pan. Beat with a mixer on medium speed until sugar dissolves. (Note: You should not feel any sugar crystals when you rub a little between your fingers; the mixture will be slightly warm but do not let it get too hot or the eggs will cook.)
Remove from heat; beat with a mixer on medium speed until pale yellow, about 5 minutes. Beat in mascarpone; set aside.
Beat whipping cream in a small bowl with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form; fold into mascarpone mixture. Beat egg whites with remaining sugar in a clean, small bowl until stiff but not dry; fold into mascarpone mixture. Set aside.
Mix the coffee and rum, if using, in a shallow bowl. Working with one ladyfinger at a time, quickly dunk one side of the ladyfinger into the liquid to moisten; place it on the dish (or dishes) coffee side up. Keep working to make a layer of coffee-moistened ladyfingers that cover the bottom of the dish. (If necessary, break some ladyfingers to fit in the dish.)
Spoon half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers; sprinkle with half of the chopped chocolate. Top with more coffee-soaked ladyfingers. Top with remaining mascarpone mixture. Sprinkle the remaining chopped chocolate over the top. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
