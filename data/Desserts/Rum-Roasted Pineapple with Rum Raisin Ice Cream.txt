Rum-Roasted Pineapple with Rum Raisin Ice Cream

8 servings

8	tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter
1	cup (packed) dark brown sugar
8	whole allspice
¼	teaspoon nutmeg
1	vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
8	slices of fresh pineapple ¾ inch thick (center core removed)
½	cup golden raisins (about 2 ounces)
2	pints rum raisin ice cream

Melt butter in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in brown sugar, rum, and allspice. Scrape seeds from the vanilla bean and add to the mixture. Cook until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon and reduced to slightly more than one cup, whisking constantly, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, discard vanilla bean and allspice, then stir in the golden raisins. (Can be made one day ahead and stored covered in the refrigerator. Reheat before using.)
Preheat broiler. Arrange pineapple rounds on a rimmed baking sheet. Brush both sides with some of the rum sauce, reserving the remaining sauce. Broil the pineapple close to the heat until deep brown on the top, watching carefully and rotating baking sheet to prevent burning, about 8 minutes. Transfer pineapple to plates, and then place a generous serving of rum raisin ice cream on each. Spoon sauce over each and serve immediately
