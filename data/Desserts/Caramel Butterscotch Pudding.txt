Caramel Butterscotch Pudding

8 servings

1	cup granulated sugar
¼	cup water
1/3	cup whipping cream
½	cup dark brown sugar
1/3	cup cornstarch
1	teaspoon fine sea salt
3	cups whole milk
4	egg yolks
¾	stick (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut up
1	teaspoon vanilla
1	teaspoon Scotch whisky

Caramelize: Pour granulated sugar and water in a saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves, 2 minutes. Turn heat to high; boil, without stirring, until mixture turns a deep golden brown, 5 minutes. Pull pan off heat; carefully pour in cream (mixture will foam up). Stir smooth.
Boil: Measure brown sugar, cornstarch and salt into another saucepan. Whisk in milk. Stir over medium heat until thick and bubbling, 5 minutes. Pull off heat. Whisk in caramel.
Thicken: Whisk egg yolks. Temper by slowly whisking in ½ cup warm pudding mixture. Whisk yolk mixture into remaining pudding mixture. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Whisk in the butter, vanilla and whiskey.
Chill: Pour into 12 demitasses. Chill 3 hours. Serve with Scotch-whisky-spiked whipped cream, with toasted pecans as an option.
