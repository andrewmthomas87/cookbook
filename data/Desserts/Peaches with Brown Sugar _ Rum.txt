Peaches with Brown Sugar & Rum

4 servings

4	peaches
Juice of ½ lemon
4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter
¼	cup firmly packed light brown sugar
2 Tbs. dark rum (optional)

Halve and pit the peaches, then cut them into slices 1/2 inch thick.
In a stainless bowl, toss together the peach slices and lemon juice. Set aside.
In a large fry pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the peaches and brown sugar and sauté the peaches until they are lightly browned and the sugar has caramelized, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and swirl in the rum.
To serve, scoop the ice cream into individual bowls. Top each serving with an equal amount of the warm peaches and drizzle with an equal amount of the pan juices. Serve immediately.
