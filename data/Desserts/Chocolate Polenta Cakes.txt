Chocolate Polenta Cakes

6 servings

8	ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
2	tablespoons hazelnut paste
4	tablespoons butter
¼	cup polenta
½	cup milk
3	egg yolks
1	teaspoon vanilla extract
4	egg whites
¼	cup sugar

Preheat oven to 375F. Butter six 3-inch ramekins and sprinkle with sugar; knock out the excess sugar. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over barely simmering water. Stir in the hazelnut paste and set aside.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and gradually stir in the polenta; cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the milk, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring frequently, for 30 minutes. Stir the chocolate mixture into the polenta. Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time, and stir in the vanilla. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.
In a large copper bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Gradually be in the sugar until stiff, glossy peaks form. Fold the whites into the polenta mixture. Spoon the batter into the prepared ramekins, filling them three-fourths full. Place the ramekins in a baking dish and add warm water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean. Serve warm.
