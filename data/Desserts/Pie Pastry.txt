Pie Pastry

Makes one 9-inch pie

2½	cups unbleached all-purpose flour (12½ ounces), plus additional flour for work surface
1	teaspoon table salt
1	tablespoon sugar
16	tablespoons unsalted butter (2 sticks), cold, cut into ½-inch cubes and frozen for 10 minutes
3	tablespoons sour cream
⅓	cup ice water , or more if needed

Process flour, salt, and sugar together in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. Add butter and pulse until butter is size of large peas, about ten 1-second pulses.
Using fork, mix sour cream and ⅓ cup ice water in small bowl until combined. Add half of sour cream mixture to flour mixture; pulse for three 1-second pulses. Repeat with remaining sour cream mixture. Pinch dough with fingers; if dough is floury, dry, and does not hold together, add 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water and process until dough forms large clumps and no dry flour remains, three to five 1-second pulses.
Turn dough out onto work surface. Divide dough into 2 balls and flatten each into 4-inch disk; wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate until firm but not hard, 1 to 2 hours, before rolling. (Dough can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Let thoroughly chilled dough stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before rolling.)
