Mascarpone Filled Crepes

6 servings

Crepe Ingredients:
1	cup sifted all-purpose flour
1	cup water
½	cup milk
2	eggs, beaten
1	tablespoon vegetable oil
½	teaspoon salt
Melted butter
Filing Ingredients:
8	ounces mascarpone cheese
¼	cup sugar
1	teaspoon grated lemon peel
2	extra-large eggs, separated – room temperature
2	orange liquor
Lightly salt
Melted butter

For the Crepes: Add all ingredients and  whisk until smooth. Heat a 6-inch diameter crepe pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Brush lightly with some of the remaining melted butter. Working quickly, ladle scant ¼ cup of the batter into the pan, tilting so the batter just coats the bottom. Immediately return excess batter to the bowl. Cook crepe until the bottom is brown, about 2 minutes. Loosen edges with a spatula and slide crepe out onto a plate and cover with waxed paper (do not cook the second side). Repeat with remaining batter, stirring occasionally. (If batter becomes thick, thin with a little additional milk.) Adjust heat and brush pan with butter as necessary. (Crepes can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
For the Filling: In a large bowl, mix the mascarpone cheese with the sugar, eggs, liquor and salt and whisk until well blended.
Place 1 crepe cooked side down on the work surface. Place 1 rounded tablespoon of the filling in the center of the crepe and fold half of the crepe over the filling. Fold in sides, then roll up, enclosing the filling completely. Repeat with remaining crepes and filling.
