Pate Brisee:
1	cup all-purpose flour
¼	teaspoon salt
3	tablespoons sugar
½	cup (1 stick) cold butter
4	to 6 tablespoons ice cold water
Tart:
½	cup sugar
½	cup corn syrup

1½	teaspoons vanilla extract
2	large Rome apples, cored, peeled and chopped
1	teaspoon lemon juice
Special equipment: 1 (9-inch) tart pan

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place flour in a medium bowl, add salt and sugar and mix well. Add butter and cut into flour, using a pastry cutter, until butter is the size of small peas. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing gently after each addition. Dough will begin to form a ball when enough water has been added. Gather dough with dry hands and form into an even ball. Let rest for 5 minutes. Roll pate brisee dough to a 12-inch circle. Place in a 9-inch tart pan and lightly press into pan.
In a large bowl, combine sugar and corn syrup. Add eggs and beat until smooth. Add melted butter and continue to beat. Add pecans and vanilla and mix well. Set aside.
In a small bowl mix the apples with lemon juice. Spread apples onto bottom of pan and pour pecan mixture over apples. Bake pie until set, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
