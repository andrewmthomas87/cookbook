Poached Pears in Vanilla Sauce

6 servings

1	cup sugar
1½	cups dry white wine
1½	cups water
6	fresh pears, with stems
Sauce:
4	egg yolks
1	cup sifted powdered sugar
1	teaspoon vanilla extract
¼	 cup dry sherry
1	cup heavy cream, whipped

Combine sugar, wine, and water in a large saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Peal pears, cut bottom off to make a flat surface, remove core from bottom, leaving stem on, and add pears to the hot syrup. Cover and simmer gently for 10 minutes, or until pears are barely tender. Remove from heart, cool pan by placing it over a bowl of ice, and refrigerate pears in syrup until chilled.
For the sauce, beat egg yolks in the top of a double boiler and gradually add powdered sugar, beating until creamy and light-colored. Blend in vanilla and sherry, cook and stir over hot, not boiling, water for 10 minutes, or until thickened. Beat until smooth, refrigerate for several hours, and then gently fold into chilled whipped cream. Remove pears from syrup, dry surface with paper towels, then cover each with sauce until it pools at the bottom of the plate.
