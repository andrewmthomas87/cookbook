Bake until tester inserted into centers comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on racks.
For Frosting: With electric mixer, beat cream cheese, butter, lemon juice and vanilla until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar. Chill until firm but spreadable, about 1 hour.
Turn cakes out of pans; peel off wax paper. Place one layer on platter. Spread ¾ cup frosting over it. Top with second cake; spread ¾ cup frosting over it. Top with third cake. Spread remaining frosting over top and sides. May be prepared a day ahead. Cover with cake dome and refrigerate. Let stand 3 hours at room temperature before serving.
