Raspberry-Pistachio Buckles

6 servings

1½	cups fresh raspberries (2 cups frozen, thawed, drained & patted dry)
¾	cup sugar
¼	cup shelled pistachios
¼	teaspoon salt
4	tablespoons butter, softened
2	large eggs
1	teaspoon vanilla extract
½	cup all purpose flour
½	teaspoon baking powder

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 375F. Lightly coat six 6-ounce ramekins with vegetable oil spray and place on a rimmed baking sheet.
Process the sugar, pistachios, and salt in a food processor until finely ground, 10 to 15 seconds. Add the butter, eggs, and vanilla and process until smooth, about 5 seconds. Add the flour and baking powder and pulse until just incorporated, about 5 pulses. Divide the batter among the ramekins. Sprinkle the berries over the batter (the berries will sink into the batter during baking).
Bake until golden and the buckles begin to pull away from the sides of the ramekins, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes before serving.
