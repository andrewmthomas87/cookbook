Chocolate Upside-Down Soufflés

Eight four-ounce soufflés

Unsalted butter for greasing soufflé cups, plus 1½ sticks.
6	ounces unsweetened chocolate, cut into small pieces
4	large eggs, separated (set out at room temperature for an hour or so)
2	teaspoons fresh lemon juice
Vanilla ice cream.

Preheat the oven to 375F. Butter 8 four-ounce soufflé ramekins and dust them with enough sugar to completely coat the bottoms and sides.
Melt 1½ sticks of butter over medium heat. Remove from heat and add the chocolate pieces. Stir with a whisk until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Set aside.
Beat the egg yolks at medium speed with a mixer, gradually adding ⅓ cup of sugar. Beat until thick and pale yellow, about 5 or 6 minutes. Pour in the butter and chocolate mixture and mix at low speed until just blended, making sure the chocolate mixture is well incorporated.
Beat the egg whites in a separate bowl until foamy and add the lemon juice. Continue beating until soft peaks form. Add the remaining tablespoon of sugar and beat until peaks are stiff and shiny. Stir ¼ of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture. Gently fold in the rest, spoon the mixture into the prepared ramekins, and place in a baking pan
Place the pan in the oven and pour in boiling water until it reaches 1 inch up the sides of the ramekins. Bake 10-15 minutes or until the tops of the soufflés are firm, and a knife inserted near the center comes out almost clean. Remove the pan from the oven and the ramekins from the pan. Let the soufflés sit for 2 minutes.
Turn the cups upside down into individual dessert plates and un-mold the soufflés. Top with vanilla ice cream, mint, and serve.
