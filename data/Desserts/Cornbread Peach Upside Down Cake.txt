Cornbread Peach Upside Down Cake

6-8 servings

2	boxes of Jiffy corn muffin mix
3	large eggs
⅔	cup orange juice
1	tablespoon vanilla extract
½	cup unsalted butter
¾	cup brown sugar
1	teaspoon kosher salt
3	ripe peaches, sliced

Preheat oven to 350F.
In a large bowl, combine both boxes of corn muffin mix with eggs, orange juice, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth then let sit 5 minutes while you prepare peaches.
Combined butter, brown sugar and salt in a 10" cast iron skillet over medium heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until butter is completely melted and mixture starts to bubble slightly.
Remove from heat and arrange peaches in pan. Pour batter over peaches. Place skillet on a baking sheet (to catch any spills) and bake about 30 to 35 minutes, or until cornbread is slightly golden and cracked, and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
Cool cake about 15 minutes, and then run a knife around edges before inverting onto a serving plate. Let cool completely before serving.
