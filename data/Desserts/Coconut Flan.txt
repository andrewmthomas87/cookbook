Coconut Flan

12 servings

2	cans (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
2	cans (12 ounces) evaporated milk0000
2	teaspoons vanilla
ground cinnamon
6	eggs
2	cups shredded coconut
2	cups sugar for caramel
2	tablespoons (or so) water for caramel

Whisk all ingredients together (except the sugar) and set aside
Preheat the oven to 350F (170C).
Fill two flat rectangular pans, (a smaller one that will fit inside the larger one) with boiling water and place in the oven. When ready, empty the water from the smaller pan, but leave the water in the larger pan.
In a small saucepan, add the water to the sugar and melt slowly at very low temperature until liquid, then boil until just golden. Turn off heat and pour the melted sugar into the smaller pan to form a caramel base. After the caramel becomes slightly sticky, pour the milk mixture on top of the caramel and set the smaller pan into the larger pan.
Bake in the oven about 45-50 minutes, until set, but still wiggly.
Cool completely in pan on a rack, then refrigerate, preferably overnight.
Un-mold by setting the pan on warm water until caramel is melted and flan is loose from sides. Place a large flat dish over the flan and invert to serve.
For decoration, drizzle any remaining caramel onto a sheet of parchment or waxed paper in decorative squiggles. Let the squiggles harden and use them as a garnish for the flan.
