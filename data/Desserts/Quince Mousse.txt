Quince Mousse

8 servings

2	pounds quince
14	ounces dark brown sugar
1	lemon, juiced
Â¼	cup dark rum
2	cups heavy cream

Preheat the oven to 325F.
Slice one or two quinces and set aside for later garnish. Place the rest of the quince in a cast-iron casserole and roast in the oven until they are soft and collapsing and their skins are just bursting, about 30 to 40 minutes.
Once the quince are cool enough to handle, remove the skin and cores and press the flesh through a sieve, transferring it to a saucepan with the brown sugar and lemon juice and, over high heat, bring the ingredients to a boil, stirring with a wooden spoon. Lower the flame and cook the quince, still stirring, for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and allow to cool.
In a medium bowl, combine the rum and cream and beat to form stiff peaks. Lighten the cooled quince with a third of the beaten cream, then gently fold the quince into the remaining cream.
Turn the mousse out into 4-ounce ramekins, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and chill for several hours. Just before serving, caramelize the reserved quince slices in olive oil in the iron skillet, then distribute over each chilled quince mousse and serve.
