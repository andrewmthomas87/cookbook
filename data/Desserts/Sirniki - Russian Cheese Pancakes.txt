Sirniki - Russian Cheese Pancakes

4 servings

1	pound dry curd cottage cheese
2	tablespoons sour cream
1	egg
½	cup flour
2	tablespoons sugar
1	tablespoon canola oil

In a food processor, pulse the cottage cheese until it is uniformly crumpled. Add the egg, sugar, and ½ cup of flour. Pulse or mix to combine. Refrigerate 1 hour, or even overnight. The dough will remain thick but sticky.
Put approximately ⅓ cup of flour into a bowl, and use this to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands. Using 2 teaspoons, drop 1½-inch balls of dough into the flour, roll them round, and flatten to about ⅜-inch thick. Place them on a plate in a single layer until all the patties are all formed.
Heat a frying pan with the canola oil and fry the patties on each side until golden. You will need to add more canola oil as you go.
Serve hot with sour cream and/or jam. This recipe will make approximately 20 small patties.
