Fruit Soufflés

4 servings

Butter & sugar for preparing ramekins
2	ounces unsalted butter
½	cup all purpose flour
1 ½ cups puréed fruit  (raspberries, strawberries, mangoes, peaches, etc.)
¼	cup granulated sugar
4	egg whites (at room temperature)
Powdered sugar for dusting

Preheat the oven to 400F.
Butter the small soufflé ramekins, then lightly dust the insides with sugar. Surround each mold with a 6 inch tall buttered aluminum foil collar. Place the molds on a baking sheet and set aside.
Melt 2 ounces of butter in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and mix well.  Remove from the heat; whisk until the roux mixture is bubbling, about 1 minute, then whisk in the fruit purée. Increase heat to medium high and simmer for 2 minutes.  Add the extra sugar a little at a time, tasting for sweetness as you go. Add a little extra sugar if necessary. Leave to cool.
Whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form, add 1 tablespoon to the fruit mixture and mix well. Fold in the remaining egg whites, being careful not to lose too much volume. Fill the ramekins to ¾ full.
Put the baking sheet with the ramekins in the oven and bake for 20-25 minuts, until risen well and golden.  Remove aluminum foil collars, dust with powdered sugar, and serve immediately.
