Chocolate Bread Pudding

6-8 Servings

6	cups lightly packed ½–inch cubes trimmed egg bread
2½	cups half-and-half
8	ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
2	large eggs
¼	cup sugar
1	teaspoon pure vanilla extract
⅛	teaspoon salt
1	tablespoon butter

Divide bread cubes evenly among eight ¾ cup ramekins or put in a 2 quart soufflé dish.
Bring half and half to simmer in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, then remove quickly from heat and add chopped semisweet chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Let this mixture cool until it will not cook the following mixture.
Combine eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt and whisk until well blended, then mix into the chocolate mixture. Pour the custard over the bread cubes in ramekins dividing evenly or in the soufflé dish. Press down on bread cubes with a spatula to saturate the bread completely. Let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, stirring with spatula frequently to soak the chocolate custard completely into the bread cubes.
Preheat oven to 325F. Cover ramekins or soufflé dish loosely with foil, then place in oven and bake until set and toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a small amount of moist chocolate still attached, about 30-35 minutes.
Serve warm topped with vanilla ice cream.
