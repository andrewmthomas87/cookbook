Sour Cream Cheesecake - Slow-Cooker

6 servings

¾	cup graham cracker crumbs
2½	tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
¼	teaspoon cinnamon
⅔	cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
Salt
12	ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
1	tablespoon all-purpose flour
2	large eggs
1	teaspoon pure almond extract
1	cup sour cream

In a medium bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter, cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of the sugar, and a pinch of salt. Press the crumbs over the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of a 6-inch spring-form pan that is 3 inches deep.
In a standing mixer fitted with a paddle, combine the cream cheese with the flour, the remaining ⅔ cup of sugar, and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Beat at medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the side of the bowl and add the eggs and the almond extract. Beat at medium speed until blended. Add the sour cream and beat until smooth. Pour the batter into the spring-form pan.
Fill a 6 to 7 quart round or oval slow-cooker with ½-inch of water and position a rack in the bottom. Set the cheesecake on the rack. Cover the slow-cooker wit a triple layer of paper towels and the lid. Turn the cooker to high and cook for 2 hours without peeking. Turn off the heat and let stand until the slow-cooker cools, about 1 hour.
Remove the lid and the paper towels and transfer the cheesecake to a rack to cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours.
Heat a sharp, thin-bladed knife under hot water, dry the knife. Carefully run the knife around the edge of the cheesecake. Release the spring and lift the cheesecake out of the mold, cut into wedges and serve
