¼	cup coarsely ground coffee beans
1⅓	cups sugar
1	cup light corn syrup
¼	cup water
4	ounces unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped

Sift cocoa into medium bowl. Bring cream and ground coffee to boil in heavy small saucepan, stirring to blend. Remove from heat; cover and steep 10 minutes. Strain cream through fine sieve into another bowl, pressing on coffee grounds to release as much cream as possible.
Bring sugar, corn syrup, ¼ cup water, and coffee-flavored cream to boil in medium saucepan, whisking until sugar dissolves. Boil 1 minute, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. Remove from heat. Whisk in chocolate, butter, and vanilla. Pour ¼ of the chocolate mixture into cocoa to moisten, then add remaining chocolate mixture, whisking until sauce is smooth and shiny.
