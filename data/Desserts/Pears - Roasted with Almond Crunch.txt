Pears - Roasted with Almond Crunch

6 servings

Almond Crunch Ingredients:
1	large egg white
3	tablespoons sugar
¾	cup sliced almonds
(2½ ounce, preferably with skins)
Pear Ingredients:
3	firm Bosc pears
1	tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
¼	cup sugar
2	tablespoons almond-flavored liqueur
½	cup water

Almond crunch: Preheat oven to 350F.
Whisk together egg white and sugar, then add the almonds, stirring until coated. Spread in a thin layer on a buttered baking sheet and bake in middle of oven until golden, 15 to 25 minutes. Cool on baking sheet on a rack, then break into pieces.
Increase oven temperature to 425F.
Roast pears:
Halve pears lengthwise and core (preferably with a melon-ball cutter). Spread butter on bottom of a 9-inch square baking pan and sprinkle with ¼ cup sugar. Arrange pears, cut sides up, on sugar, then brush cut sides with 1 tablespoon Amaretto.
Roast pears, uncovered, in middle of oven until barely tender, about 25 minutes. Add water, remaining tablespoon Amaretto, and a pinch of salt to baking pan, then baste pears with pan juices. Roast pears, basting twice with pan juices, until tender, about 15 minutes more.
Serve pears warm or at room temperature, drizzled with pan juices and topped with almond crunch.
