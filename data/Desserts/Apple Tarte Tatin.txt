For crust:Combine flour, sugar, and ½ teaspoon salt in food processor; blend 5 seconds.Add chilled unsalted butter; using on/off turns, process until a coarse meal forms.Add 5 tablespoons sour cream; using on/off turns, blend until some clumps form.Add remaining 1 tablespoon sour cream if the dough is dry and blend until moist clumps form.Gather dough into a ball; flatten into a disk.Wrap in plastic and chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 13-inch round.Slide round onto a rimless baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to use.
For apple topping:Preheat oven to 425F.Place butter in a heavy large ovenproof skillet (about 12 inches wide and at least 2 inches deep).Place skillet over high heat.Add sugar and brown sugar and whisk until blended and mixture is almost smooth, about 2 minutes.Turn off heat.Arrange apple quarters on their sides in 2 concentric circles in skillet, crowding in as many as possible (there may be extra).Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice.Cook over medium-high heat until the syrup is a deep amber color and very thick, fitting in remaining apples as space permits, about 30 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat.Slide chilled crust atop apples in skillet.Press crust edges (which will soften from the hot skillet) down around the apples at the edge of the skillet.Cut several slits in the crust to allow steam to escape.Place skillet in oven.Bake until crust is deep golden brown, about 35 minutes.Let tart cool 5 minutes.Cut around edge of skillet to loosen pastry.Place large platter over the skillet and invert, allowing the tart to settle onto the platter.Wait 3 minutes, the slowly lift off the skillet.Rearrange any apples that may have moved.Let stand at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours at room temperature.
