Orange-Almond Cake

8-10 pieces

1	navel orange
8	 ounces slivered almonds
1	cup sugar, divided
½	cup flour
1	teaspoon baking powder
1	teaspoon baking soda
¼	teaspoon salt
6	tablespoons unsalted butter plus
1 tablespoon for greasing the
pan, at room temperature
5	eggs

Place orange in a small saucepan and cover with water. Put a heatproof glass plate or pot lid on the orange to keep it submerged. Place over medium heat, bring to a boil, turn down heat and simmer 30 minutes. Remove orange and cool. (You can immerse it in cold water to hasten this.) Cut orange in half, each half into 4 to 6 wedges, and the wedges into chunks. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 350F. Generously butter either a 9-inch Bundt pan, an 8-inch tube pan or a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.
Place almonds in a food processor with 2 tablespoons of sugar and process until nuts are finely ground. Remove from the processor bowl. Pour a handful of ground almonds into cake pan, then shake pan to evenly distribute almonds. Bang out any excess almonds and return them to the rest of the nuts.
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in small bowl. Cut butter into pieces.
Place orange chunks -- peel, pith and all -- into the bowl of a food processor with the remaining sugar. Process until orange is pureed. Add the ground almonds and the butter and process until well mixed. Add eggs and process until they are integrated. Add dry ingredients and process until just combined. Immediately pour batter into cake pan and bake until cake is nicely browned and starting to come away from the edges, about an hour. A wood skewer inserted into the center should come out clean. When pan is cool enough to handle, loosen the cake with a thin, narrow knife, then unmold cake and let it cool out of the pan. Makes 8 to 12 servings.
