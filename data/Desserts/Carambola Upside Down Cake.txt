Carambola Upside Down Cake

8 to 12 servings

¼	cup plus 3 tablespoons brown sugar
¼	cup water
1	tablespoon butter, plus 3 tablespoons softened
1	cinnamon stick
2	star anise
1	piece (½-inch long) ginger root, peeled
1	teaspoon lime juice
5	medium carambolas, sliced 1/2-inch thick, seeded
Cake batter:
2	cups cake flour, sifted
1	teaspoon baking powder
½	teaspoon each: baking soda, salt
1	 cup sugar
1	stick butter, softened
3	large eggs
1	 cup sour cream
¼	to ½ cup coconut flakes, optional

Heat the oven to 350F. Heat ¼ cup of the brown sugar, water, 1 tablespoon of the butter, cinnamon, star anise, ginger and lime juice in a skillet over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Add carambola; cook, tossing gently, until glazed and softened a bit, about 7 minutes. Cool.
Beat remaining 3 tablespoons of the butter and 3 tablespoons of the sugar with a wooden spoon in a bowl until mixed. Spread mixture on bottom of a 9-inch cast-iron skillet or round cake pan.
For the batter, whisk the flour with the baking powder, soda and salt. In another bowl, beat the sugar with the butter until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Fold the dry ingredients into the butter-egg mixture in three additions, alternating with the sour cream and coconut.
Remove the cinnamon and star anise from the carambola; arrange the slices in the skillet. (Reserve cooking sauce.) Pour the batter over the fruit; smooth with a spatula. Bake 40-45 minutes; cool 5 minutes. Unmold cake onto a platter; drizzle with reserved cooking sauce.
