Coconut Macaroons

10-12 servings

4	large egg whites
Pinch of salt
½	cup sugar
¼	cup (packed) golden brown sugar
8	ounces sweetened shredded coconut, lightly toasted

Preheat oven to 350F. In a mixer fitted with a whip attachment, whip egg whites and salt until they become white and begin to stiffen. Add sugar in 3 parts. Continue to whip until the egg whites are very stiff. Using a rubber spatula fold in toasted coconut.
On parchment lined cookie sheets, drop a teaspoon of the mixture leaving 1 to 2 inches around each cookie. Place into the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. The outside should be golden brown but the insides should still be moist.
