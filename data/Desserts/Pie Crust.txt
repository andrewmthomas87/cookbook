Pie Crust

1 double crust

2	cups flour
1	teaspoon salt
2	sticks of butter (cold or even frozen), cut into small pieces
One cup cold water

In the bowl of a food processor, add flour and salt. Pulse to combine. (Alternately, whisk flour and salt in a bowl.)
Add butter. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs or pebbles with some larger pieces remaining. (Or, cut in butter using a pastry blender.)
With machine running, add ice water in a steady stream until the dough holds together. If it's too crumbly, add more water.
Turn out dough on a clean work surface. Divide in half and place each half on a piece of plastic wrap. Flatten into discs, wrap in plastic and refrigerate or freeze up to a month.
