Poached Pears with Marsala

4 servings

4 bosc pears, peeled, stem still attached, ¼ inch of bottom sliced off so pears can easily sit upright
1	cup dry Marsala wine (or Madeira)
1½	Tbsp lemon juice
¼	cup white sugar
4	cloves
½	stick cinnamon

In a saucepan just large enough to fit all of the pears, place the Marsala wine, sugar, lemon juice, star anise, cloves, and cinnamon. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and place the pears in the pan, standing upright. Cover the pan and cook for 10 to 15 minutes (if you want, baste with the liquid a couple of times during the cooking), until the pears can easily be pierced with a fork. Very firm pears make need to cook for up to 20 minutes.
Remove the pears to a serving dish. Keeping the pan uncovered, let the Marsala syrup boil down for a few minutes until it is a thick syrup. (If it begins to caramelize, remove pan from the heat and add a little water to the pan to stop the cooking.) Pour syrup over pears and serve.
