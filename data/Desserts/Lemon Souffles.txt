Lemon Soufflés

8 servings

1	cup milk
7	tablespoons sugar (1 for egg whites)
1	tablespoon grated lemon peel
3	large egg yolks
¼	cup fresh lemon juice
3	tablespoons all purpose flour
Pinch of salt & cream tartar (optional)
Additional sugar for dusting ramekins
6 large egg whites
2	tablespoons kirsch (clear cherry brandy) or other brandy
Powdered sugar

Bring milk, 6 tablespoons of the sugar and the lemon peel to boil in a heavy medium saucepan, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and let cool 20 minutes.
Whisk egg yolks and lemon juice in a medium bowl to blend. Add flour and whisk until smooth. Whisk in milk mixture. Return mixture to the saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Continue boiling 1 minute until mixture thickens. Transfer to a medium bowl, press plastic wrap onto surface of the lemon pastry cream and cool. (Can be prepared 3 days in advance. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 400F. Butter eight ½ cup to 1 cup ramekins, then dust with sugar. Form a 6 inch high buttered aluminum foil collar around each ramekin and place on cookie sheet. Beat egg whites with salt in a large copper bowl until soft peaks form. Add remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar and beat until medium-stiff peaks form. Mix kirsch into the lemon pastry cream, then fold in ⅓ of the egg whites. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Divide mixture among the prepared ramekins. Bake until the soufflés puff and the tops are brown, about 25 minutes. Remove aluminum foil collars, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve immediately.
