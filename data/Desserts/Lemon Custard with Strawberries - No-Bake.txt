Lemon Custard with Strawberries - No-Bake

6 servings

For the custard:
2	cups heavy cream
⅔	cup granulated sugar
2	teaspoons finely grated lemon zest
Pinch of fine sea salt
⅓	cup fresh lemon juice
For the strawberry topping:
1	cup sliced strawberries
1	to 2 teaspoons granulated sugar

In a medium saucepan, combine cream, sugar, lemon zest and salt over medium-high heat. Bring to simmer, stirring frequently to dissolve sugar. Simmer vigorously until mixture thickens slightly, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Let sit until mixture has cooled slightly and a skin forms on top, about 20 minutes.
Stir mixture, then strain through fine-mesh strainer into a measuring cup with a spout; discard zest. Pour mixture evenly into six 6-ounce ramekins or small bowls.
Refrigerate, uncovered, until set, at least 3 hours.
As the custards chill, prepare the strawberry topping: Toss strawberries and sugar in a small mixing bowl. Let fruit macerate at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until the sugar is dissolved.
To serve, top each lemon custard with some strawberry topping on top.
