Strawberry-Rhubarb Tart

6-8 servings

Crust:
12	tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
½	cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1	large egg at room temperature
½	teaspoon vanilla
1¾	cups unbleached flour
pinch of salt
Filling:
2	cups fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced
½	pound rhubarb, cut into ¼-inch pieces, about 2 cups
⅔	cup heavy cream
⅓	cup firmly packed light brown sugar
2	large eggs

For dough:  Using a heavy- duty mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat butter on medium speed until creamy. Add sugar and beat until pale. Beat in egg and vanilla. Turn speed to low, add flour salt and mix until just blended. Flatten dough to a ½-inch-thick disk and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.
Preheat oven to 400 F. Unwrap dough and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll into ⅛-inch-thick round. Fit dough into a 9-inch round tart pan with a removable bottom. Ease dough into bottom and up sides of pan, then run rolling pin over top to cut off excess. Press dough to sides of pan. Freeze tart shell for 20 minutes.
To assemble and bake tart, strew strawberries and rhubarb in tart shell. Whisk cream, sugar and eggs together. Pour over fruit, leaving a 1/8-inch margin at the top so it won't overflow in oven.
Bake until firm and well browned, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool completely.
In a small saucepan, mix preserves with 2 tablespoons water. Heat over low heat. Push through a sieve with back of a spoon. Brush tart with glaze and let set, 1 hour
