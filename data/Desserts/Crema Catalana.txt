Crema Catalana

4 servings

1½	 cups milk
½	cup heavy cream
Zest of 1 orange and 1 lemon, cut into wide strips
2	cinnamon sticks
4	egg yolks
¼	cup sugar
3	tablespoon sweet sherry
1	teaspoon vanilla extract
Topping
2	tablespoons sugar

Preheat the oven to 325F and boil a kettleful of water.
In a small saucepan, combine the milk, cream, sugar, lemon and orange zests, and cinnamon sticks. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then remove from heat and set aside to infuse, covered, for 30 minutes.
Strain the infused milk, and discard the solids. Pour the milk back into the saucepan and bring to a simmer once more over medium heat.
In a mixing bowl, lightly beat the egg yolks, sugar, sherry and vanilla extract. Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking briskly as you go to keep the eggs from curdling.
Set four one-cup ovenproof ramekins into a deep baking dish. Evenly distribute custard between the ramekins. Place dish in preheated oven, then carefully fill with boiling water until it comes halfway up the sides of ramekins, being careful not to get any water into the custards. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes, until custard is barely set around the edges and a little wobbly in the middle. Remove ramekins from the baking dish, cool for a few minutes, then place in the refrigerator to cool completely, about 2 hours.
Before serving, sprinkle ½ tablespoon of sugar on top of each ramekin. Using a small blowtorch held about 2″ away from the surface of the dish, work the flame over the sugar to caramelize, making sure not to linger too long over a single spot to ensure a nice even caramelization. (As mentioned above, you can also place the sugar-topped custards under a hot broiler for 30-45 seconds, or as long as it takes for the sugar to melt into a thin layer of golden-brown caramel) Serve right away.
