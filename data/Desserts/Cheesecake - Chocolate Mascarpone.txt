Cheesecake  - Chocolate Mascarpone

12 servings

2	cups finely ground chocolate
graham crackers (about 36 squares)
¼	cup sugar
½	cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
Filling
6	ounces semisweet chocolate
3	eight-ounce packages cream cheese
¾	cup sugar
1½	 teaspoon vanilla extract
¼	cup all purpose flour
3	large eggs
8	ounces mascarpone cheese

For Crust: Preheat oven to 325F. Mix graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a food processor to blend. Add butter; process until moist clumps form. Press mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch spring-form pan with 2¾ inch high sides. Bake for 12 minutes. Cool in pan on rack. Wrap outside and bottom of pan with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil to prevent leakage. Maintain oven temperature.
For Filling: Stir chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water until melted and smooth. Cool to lukewarm.
Using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally. Gradually add flour, beating until well blended. Mix in mascarpone cheese, then the melted chocolate.
Pour filling into the crust. Place spring-form pan in a large roasting pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the spring-form pan. Bake cake until filling is just set in the center, but still moves slightly, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove cake from water bath; transfer to a rack and cool completely, about 4 hours. Cover and chill overnight.
Run a thin knife around the top edge of the cheese cake to loosen. Remove pan sides. Transfer cake to platter.
