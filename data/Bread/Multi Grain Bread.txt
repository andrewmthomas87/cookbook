Make a sponge by dissolving yeast in warm water; add 1½ tablespoons molasses and the honey; mix and let rest to make soft sponge. Add 1½ tablespoons safflower oil, salt, vinegar, cornmeal, rye flour, the all purpose and whole wheat flour. Knead until elastic, about 100 times. Add cooked grains, kneading until fully mixed. Place in oiled bowl; cover with damp cloth and let rise to double in bulk.
