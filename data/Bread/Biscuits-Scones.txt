Biscuits-Scones

8 servings

1¾	cups all-purpose flour
3	tablespoons sugar
1	tablespoon baking powder
½	teaspoon salt
1	cup heavy cream
melted unsalted butter for brushing the tops

Preheat the oven to 425F. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl and stir to combine. Pour in the cream and mix until a stiff dough forms. (If the mixture is too dry, add milk by the tablespoonful.) Turn onto a lightly floured surface and lightly knead for about 30 seconds. Brush the tops with melted butter.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until nicely browned.
For biscuits: Pat or lightly roll into a ½ inch thick rectangle or oval. Cut the dough into rounds of the desired size and place on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
For drop biscuits or scones: The easiest of all. Use two large spoons or a portion (aka ice cream) scoop to drop the dough onto the baking sheet.
For scones: Pat into a 12x6-inch rectangle. Cut into 3-inch lengths crosswise, and then cut each rectangle into triangles. Place on a greased pan – preferably lined with parchment paper – at least 2 inches apart and brush with melted butter. Sprinkle with the sugar and place in oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until nicely browned.
Cream biscuits and scones are delectable “au naturel,” but you can create endless variations with this master recipe by adding cinnamon, raisins, dried fruits, orange zest, or nuts..
