Chive Popovers

24 popovers

4	large eggs
2	cups whole milk, room temperature
2	cups all purpose flour
¼	cup finely chopped chives or scallion greens
2	tablespoons (¼ stick unsalted butter, melted)
1	teaspoon salt

Preheat oven to 425F. Butter 24 muffin cups and place in mini-muffin tin. Mix all ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk only until tiny specks of flour remain, about 1 minute. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.) Divide batter among the muffin cup, filling each completely. Without opening the oven door at any point, bake until the muffins are golden brown on top, 20-30 minutes.
