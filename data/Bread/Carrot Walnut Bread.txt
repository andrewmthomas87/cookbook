Carrot Walnut Bread

one loaf

Vegetable oil cooking spray
3	medium carrots (7 ounces), thickly sliced
½	cup walnut halves
1½	cups all-purpose flour
1	teaspoon baking soda
1	teaspoon baking soda
1	teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1	teaspoon cinnamon
½	teaspoon salt
2	large eggs
1	cup sugar
¼	cup vegetable oil
¼	cup low-fat buttermilk

Preheat the oven to 350F. Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add the carrots and boil over moderate heat until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash the carrots with a potato masher, then let cool.
Meanwhile, toast the walnuts for about 7 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let cool, then chop coarsely.
Sift the flour with the baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the sugar until pale yellow. Whisk in the oil and buttermilk. Stir in the carrots and walnuts, then stir in the flour mixture until blended.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 50 minutes, or until risen and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn it out onto a rack to cool completely.
