Crepes - Basic

12 crepes

1 cup all-purpose flour
3	large eggs, beaten
1½	cups whole milk
¼	teaspoon salt
4	tablespoons melted unsalted butter

Whisk together the flour, eggs, milk, salt, and 3 tablespoons of the butter to form a smooth, thin batter.
For sweet crepes, add ½ teaspoon sugar and ½ teaspoon vanilla extract.
Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before proceeding.
Heat a heavy 6-inch skillet or crepe pan over medium-high heat. When hot, brush with a light coating of the remaining butter. Ladle about 2 ounces of crepe batter into the pan, tilting the skillet to evenly coat the pan with batter. Cook until golden brown on the bottom and the top begins to look dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Using a spatula, carefully turn the crepe and cook on the second side just until the bottom colors slightly, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with waxed paper to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter.
