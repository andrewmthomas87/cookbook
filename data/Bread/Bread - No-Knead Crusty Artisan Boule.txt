Bread – No-Knead Crusty Artisan Boule

1 loaf

3	cups all-purpose flour
2	to 3 teaspoons kosher salt
½	teaspoon dry yeast (active dry or highly active dry work best)
1½	cups lukewarm water
Special cookware needed: Dutch oven or any large oven-safe dish/bowl and lid

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt and yeast. Add the water and stir using a wooden spoon until the mixture forms a shaggy but cohesive dough. Do not over-work the dough. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let dough sit at room temperature for 8-24 hours. Dough will bubble up and rise.
After dough is ready, preheat oven to 450F. Place a Dutch oven, uncovered, into the preheated oven for 30 minutes. While the Dutch oven preheats, turn dough onto a well-floured surface and, with floured hands, form the dough into a ball. Cover dough loosely with plastic wrap and let rest. After the 30 minutes are up, carefully remove the Dutch oven. With floured hands, place the bread dough into it. (You can put a piece of parchment under the dough if the Dutch oven isn’t enamel coated.) Replace cover and bake for 30 minutes covered. Carefully remove cover and bake for 7-15 minutes* more, uncovered.
Carefully remove bread to a cutting board and slice with a bread knife.
NOTES:
Uncovered baking time depends on your oven. In some ovens, the bread only needs 7 minutes uncovered until crusty and golden brown, but this can vary. Just keep an eye on it!
Whole wheat flour or white whole wheat flour in this recipe will result in the bread being very dense, and not as fluffy and delicious.
