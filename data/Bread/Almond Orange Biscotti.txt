Almond Orange Biscotti

20-24 biscotti

Vegetable shortening and flour (for baking sheet
2¼	cups all-purpose flour
1¼	cup. sugar
¼	teaspoon baking powder
Pinch of salt
3	eggs, lightly beaten
1	tablespoon vegetable oil
¼	teaspoon almond extract
Finely grated zest of 1 orange
½	cup coarsely chopped almonds

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a baking sheet. Shake off excess. In a large bowl, sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together. Make a well in center of the mixture. To the well, add remaining ingredients. With your hands, work dry mixture with liquids until a dough has been formed. Divide the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, shape dough into 2 flat bottomed cylinders, 1 inch high, 2 1/2 inches wide, and 8 inches long. Remove each to the baking sheet.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until lightly colored on top. Remove from oven and cool slightly. Holding a long sharp knife by the handle and tip, cut cylinders diagonally into ¾ inch slices. Carefully place slices back on baking sheet; cut sides down. Return them to the oven for 15 minutes more and bake until sides are golden and biscotti have dried a bit. Remove from oven and cook on wire racks. The biscotti should be somewhat hard and crunchy.
