French Bread - Jeff Smith

4 loaves

2	pounds + 3 ounces bread flour
2	packages active dry yeast
2½	cups tepid water
1	teaspoon salt
1	teaspoon tepid water
1	egg white

Preheat the oven to 400F.
Mix 4 measured cups of the baking flour into the 2½ cups of tepid water in an electric mixer with a bread attachment. Mix for 10 minutes, then add the rest of the bread flour, the salt, and the final teaspoon of tepid water. Mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the mixing bowl, then knead into a round loaf and let rise for 1-2 hours under a large bowl on the ht counter-top. After rising, punch down, knead again, then let rise again for another hour. Cut the dough into 4 loaves and knead into round loaves by tucking the edges underneath the center repeatedly. Coat the bottom of the 4 loaves with white cornmeal and let rise again. Cut an X in the top of each loaf and coat with the egg white for a brown glaze. Bake for 25-30 minutes on an insulate cookie sheet with a pan of water on the bottom shelf of the oven.
