2	boxes (8.5-ounce) cornbread mix
½	cup buttermilk, at room temperature
3	tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

10	large pimiento-stuffed green olives, 		   coarsely chopped to yield ½ cup

Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400F. Liberally spray an 8-by-8-inch glass baking dish with vegetable oil cooking spray. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix together the cornbread mix, buttermilk, melted butter, eggs, olives, scallions, and cheese until the mixture forms a thick, lumpy batter. Using a spatula spread the batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow the cornbread to cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Cut into 1½-inch squares and serve.
