Churros

10 churros

½	cup plus 1½ tablespoons sugar, divided
1½	teaspoons ground cinnamon
1	cup water
½	teaspoon salt
2	tablespoons plus 2 quarts vegetable oil, divided
1	cup all-purpose flour

Combine ½ cup sugar with the cinnamon in a shallow bowl. Set aside. Line a plate with paper towels.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the water, 1½ tablespoons sugar, salt and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Bring the mixture to a boil then remove it from the heat. Stir in the flour, mixing until it forms a ball.
Heat 3 to 4 inches of vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot set over medium-high heat until it reaches 375F. (There should be a minimum of 3 inches above the oil to prevent it from bubbling over.)
Transfer the dough to a cloth pastry bag or heavy-duty plastic bag fitted with a large star tip.
Pipe the dough over the pot of oil to a length of about 4 inches, then using scissors or a sharp knife, cut it so it releases into the oil. (Stand back to avoid any splatters.) Pipe two to three churros into the oil at a time, frying them until they're golden brown and cooked through. Transfer the churros to the paper towel-lined plate to drain for 2 minutes, and then roll them in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Repeat the frying and coating process with the remaining dough.
