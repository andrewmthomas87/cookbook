Make a sponge by dissolving yeast in warm water; add 3 cups hard whole wheat flour, 1½ tablespoons molasses, honey and rolled oats; mix and let rest to make soft sponge. Add 1½ tablespoons safflower oil, salt, vinegar, rye flour, cornmeal and 3 cups hard whole wheat flour. Knead until elastic, about 100 times. Add cooked grains, kneading until fully mixed. Place in oiled bowl; cover with damp cloth and let rise to double in bulk.
Punch down and form into 2 loaves; place in oiled bread pans and let rise to double. Bake at 350F for 45 minutes or until done.
