Pancakes – Light, Fluffy, & Rich

8 six inch pancakes

1	cup ricotta or cottage cheese
1	cup sour cream or plain yogurt
3	eggs, separated
½	teaspoon baking soda
1	cup all-purpose flour
2	tablespoons sugar
2	tablespoons lemon juice
2	teaspoons grated lemon zest
Butter or oil as needed

Beat together the ricotta or cottage cheese, the sour cream or yogurt and the egg yolks. Combine the baking soda, flour, salt, and sugar. Beat the egg whites until fairly stiff, but not dry.
Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat while you finish the batter. Stir the flour mixture into the cheese mixture, blending well, but not beating. Stir in the lemon juice and zest, and then gently fold in the beaten egg whites. If the batter is too thick, thin with a little bit of milk until it is the desired consistency.
Add about 1 tablespoon of butter to the griddle or skillet and coat the surface. When it is hot, add batter with a large serving spoon until the pancake is the desired size. Cook until lightly browned on the bottom, about 3-5 minutes (small holes will appear on the uncooked surface), then turn and cook the second side.
