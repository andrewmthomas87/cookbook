Spanish Omelet

6 servings

1	 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil plus more for drizzling
¼	cup diced each: red bell pepper, green bell pepper
2	tablespoons diced yellow bell pepper
½	teaspoon salt
Freshly ground pepper
1	large fresh plum tomato, peeled, seeded, chopped
8	large eggs
3	thin slices Serrano ham or prosciutto, sliced into thin strips
¼	cup pitted black olives
6	leaves fresh basil, cut crosswise into fine strips

Heat the oven to 400F. Heat a heavy ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil; heat. Add the peppers; cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Season with ¼ teaspoon of the salt and pepper to taste. Add the tomatoes; cook 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, break the eggs into a large bowl. Season with the remaining ¼ teaspoon of the salt and pepper to taste; whisk well. Add the eggs to the skillet; cook, stirring constantly, until curds start to form. Cook until the mixture has begun to set but is still moist.
Remove the skillet from the heat; scatter the ham and olives over the top. Put the skillet in the oven; cook until the omelet is completely set but still slightly moist, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven; sprinkle with the basil. Drizzle with olive oil. Let sit 5 minutes. Cut into wedges.
