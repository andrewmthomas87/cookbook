Basic Pancakes

48 servings

1	cup all purpose flour
2	tablespoons sugar
2	teaspoons baking powder
Â½	teaspoon salt
1	cup milk
2	tablespoons butter or vegetable oil
1	large egg
1	tablespoon vegetable oil

Preheat oven to 200F for keeping pancakes warm if preparing in advance.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder and salt together in a small bowl. Whisk milk, butter (or oil) and egg together in a medium mixing bowl. Add dry ingredients to the milk mixture and whisk until just moistened.
Head a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half and moisten with oil; carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel. For each pancake, spoon 2-3 tablespoons of batter onto the skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread the batter into a round pancake.
Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1-2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula and cook until browned on the underside, 1-2 minutes more. Serve immediately, or transfer to a baking sheet or platter, cover loosely with foil and keep warm in oven.
