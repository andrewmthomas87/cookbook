Danish Doughnuts - Ableskiver

20 servings

1	cup  flour
1	tablespoon sugar
1½	teaspoons baking powder
1	pinch salt
2	eggs
1½	cups milk

Mix dry ingredients in a bowl.
Place eggs in a measuring cup and cover with milk until it reaches 1⅔ cups. Beat eggs & milk. Add liquids to dry ingredients. Mix well but don't beat.
Cook over a fairly low heat with ¼ tsp oil in the bottom of each space. When bubbly around the edges and looking half cooked use a knitting needle (or fork to flip over). A pan usually makes ten so when you take them out keep warm in the oven.
Serve with butter & sugar or your favorite preserve.
