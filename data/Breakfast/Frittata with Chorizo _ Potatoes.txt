Frittata with Chorizo & Potatoes

8-12 servings

3	or four medium red potatoes
1	large yellow onion, sliced thin
3	cloves garlic, minced
1	large red bell pepper, diced
½	pound chorizo, sliced thin
½	cup chopped cilantro
12	eggs, beaten until frothy

Boil the potatoes until soft, 15-20 minutes. Cool completely, then cut into ¾ inch dice and set aside. Sauté the onions, garlic, and red pepper in a large heavy skillet over medium heat until softened. Add the chorizo and warm completely. Add the potatoes and the cilantro and mix well.
Preheat the oven to 450F.
Beat the eggs until frothy, then pour over the other ingredients in the skillet and mix well. Cook over medium heat, mixing until the eggs start to get firm. Place the skillet in the hot oven for 5 or 6 minutes until the frittata becomes solid.
Cut into wedges and serve while warm.
