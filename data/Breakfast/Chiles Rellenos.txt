Chiles Rellenos

6 servings

4	mild green chili peppers like Poblano, Anaheim or Banana
(alternatively, 2 seven-ounce cans of whole green chilies
2	tablespoons of salt in two quarts of water
½	pound Cheddar cheese, grated
½	pound Monterey Jack cheese, grated
2	cups evaporated mile (or Milnot)
4	eggs
⅓	cup all purpose flour
1	teaspoon salt

Preheat oven to 350F.
If using fresh mild chili peppers, cut off the stem end and remove the seed pod with a thin knife. Heat about two quarts of salted water to boiling. Immerse the chili peppers in the boiling water (be sure to get water into each of the peppers); reduce to a vigorous simmer and cook for 20-25 minutes until soft. Remove the chili peppers from the water with a slotted spoon or wooden tongs and dry carefully with paper towels. Split each chili pepper in half and remove seeds and stringy parts.
Layer the whole green chili halves to cover the bottom of a 10-12 inch quiche dish. Mix the grated Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese and layer on top of the chilies. Put the evaporated milk, eggs, flour, and salt in a blender, blend thoroughly, and then pour evenly over the chilies and cheese. Bake for 45 minutes until a golden brown crust appears on the top. If it starts to get too brown after about 30 minutes, cover loosely with a sheet aluminum foil to prevent further browning. Remove from oven and cool for 10-15 minutes. Cut around the outside edge with a thin knife, then cut into wedges and serve.
