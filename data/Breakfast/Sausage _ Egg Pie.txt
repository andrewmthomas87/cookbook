Preheat oven to 375F
Place sausage in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook 5 minutes, until browned on all sides.
In a large bowl, combine sausage, 5 eggs, spinach, mozzarella cheese, ricotta, shallot, pepper, garlic powder and salt.  Line a 9-inch pie plate with 1 of the pie crusts.  Spoon in the sausage-and-spinach mixture.  Top with the remaining pie crust; seal and crimp edges.  Poke a few holes in the center of the pie crust and brush with the egg-water mixture.
