Broccoli Rabe, Ham & Parmesan Soufflé

6-8 servings

10	ounces broccoli rabe, trimmed & chopped
1	slice firm white bread, processed to crumbs in a food processor (1/2 cup)
½	cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
4	tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
3	tablespoons all-purpose flour
1½	cups milk
¼	teaspoon salt
¼	teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3	large eggs, separated
2	large egg whites
4	ounces lean ham, cut into julienne strips (1 cup)

Preheat the oven to 375F. Wash the broccoli rabe and transfer it, still wet, to a skillet. Cook over medium-high heat for 2 minutes, until wilted. Remove from the heat and cool. Drain the broccoli rabe and coarsely chop it; set aside. Mix the bread crumbs and 3 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese together in a small bowl.
Using 1 teaspoon of the butter, grease the sides and bottom of a 6-cup gratin dish. Add half of the bread crumb mixture and shake the dish until the crumbs coat the sides and bottom. Set aside.
Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons butter in a saucepan. Add the flour, mixing with a whisk, and cook over medium-high heat for about 30 seconds. Whisk in the milk, salt, and pepper, bring to a boil, whisking constantly, and cook, whisking, until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and whisk in the egg yolks. Add the reserved broccoli rabe and the ham and mix well.
Beat the 5 egg whites in a large bowl until firm but still soft. Fold them into the spinach (or broccoli rabe) mixture, along with the remaining tablespoon of cheese. Pour the soufflé mixture into the prepared gratin dish and sprinkle the remaining bread crumb mixture on top. Place the dish on a cookie sheet, and bake in the center of the oven for about 30 minutes, until the soufflé is set and the top is puffy and brown.
Spoon the soufflé directly from the gratin dish onto plates and serve immediately.
