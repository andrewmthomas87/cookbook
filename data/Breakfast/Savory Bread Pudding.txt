Savory Bread Pudding

6-8 Servings

1	loaf olive ciabatta cut into half-inch cubes, about 14 ounces
¾	pound apple wood smoked bacon, cut into 2 inch pieces
1	cup jarred roast peppers, rinsed, drained, chopped
3	cups spinach leaves
3	cups shredded Cheddar cheese
6 large eggs
4	cups milk or half-and-half
2	teaspoons Dijon mustard
½	teaspoon salt
Freshly ground pepper

Place bread cubes on a baking sheet; let dry out overnight if you have the time.
Cook the bacon in a large skillet on medium-high heat, turning once to evenly brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels, then cut into 2 inch pieces.
Place the bread cubes in a greased 9-by-13-inch-baking dish. Spoon over the bacon, peppers and spinach leaves evenly. Sprinkle on 2 cups Cheddar cheese. Mix the ingredients around until evenly distributed.
Combine the eggs, milk, mustard, salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Whisk to blend well. Carefully pour the mixture over the bread evenly. Press the bread into the egg mixture. Sprinkle the top with remaining 1 cup of the Cheddar cheese. Allow to rest until egg mixture soaks into bread cubes, about 1 hour or cover tightly with foil and refrigerate overnight.
Remove the pudding from the refrigerator an hour before baking. Heat the oven to 350F. Bake until slightly puffed, set and browned on the top, about 1 hour. (If the center is still underdone, push down the bread to let the custard absorb into the bread and bake a few more minutes.) Let the Strata rest for a few minutes; cut into squares and serve. The bread pudding can be served slightly warmed or even at room temperature.
