Aebleskivers - Basic

21 pieces

2	cups flour
2	large eggs
1	cup sour cream
1	teaspoon baking powder
1½	cup buttermilk
Butter cut into ¼ teaspoon pieces
For sweet aebleskivers add:
1	tablespoon sugar
1	teaspoon baking powder
1	cup fruit (chopped apples, berries, raspberry jam, etc.)
For savory aebleskivers add:
1	cup sautéed sausage or
1	cup diced pepper jack cheese
1	cup sautéed mushrooms

Place aebleskiver pan over medium-high burner and bring up to heat (to the point where butter sizzles on the surface).
In a separate pan, lightly sauté the filling ingredients and season appropriately.
Separate the eggs and beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Whisk egg yolks and sugar together until creamy. Sift together flour and baking powder; gradually stir flour and buttermilk, alternating with each ½ cup addition, into egg mixture. Gently fold beaten egg whites into batter.
Reduce heat under aebleskiver pan to medium. Place ¼ teaspoon butter into each well to grease, using a pastry brush to coat surface of wells entirely.
Spoon batter into each well, filling half-way (about 1 teaspoon). Place a filling chunk on batter, then spoon enough additional batter over to cover and fill well to the top. Allow to cook until the edges of each “pancake” begin to brown and pull away from the sides of the wells.
Lightly run a chopstick around the edge of each ball to loosen, and then flip over to cook through (about 2 minutes).
For sweet aebleskivers sprinkle with cinnamon flavored sugar.
