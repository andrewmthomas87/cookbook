Wild Mushroom Quesadillas

8 medium Quesadillas or 24 appetizer size

4	tablespoons vegetable oil
1	pound chanterelles, black trumpet, oyster, crimini or clamshell mushrooms roughly chopped
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
½	cup minced yellow onion
4	ounces grated Muenster cheese
4	ounces grated mozzarella cheese
4	ounces grated Parmesan cheese
⅓	cup finely chopped cilantro leaves
1	teaspoon dried oregano
½	teaspoon ground coriander
8	eight-inch flour or corn tortillas

Place a medium sauté pan over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil. When the oil shimmers, add the mushrooms and a generous pinch of salt. Sauté until the mushrooms release their liquid, the liquid evaporates, and the mushrooms begin to brown, about 10 minutes.
Add the onions. Sauté, adjusting the heat as necessary, until the onions are soft and the entire mixture is golden brown but not burned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
Using a food processor or a knife, finely chop the mushroom-onion mixture, and then transfer to a large bowl. Add the grated cheeses, cilantro, oregano, and coriander. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Place a large non-stick or well-seasoned skillet over medium heat; add remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. While the pan heats, place a large spoonful of the mushroom-cheese mixture into the center of a tortilla and fold in half to make a half-moon.
Place filled tortilla in a preheated skillet and cook, turning once, until tortilla is nicely browned on both sides and the cheese is melted. Repeat to make 8 filled tortillas. Serve immediately.
