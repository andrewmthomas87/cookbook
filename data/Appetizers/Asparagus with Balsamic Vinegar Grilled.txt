Asparagus with Balsamic Vinegar Grilled

one appetizer per asparagus spear

Fresh asparagus spears cut to uniform length

Balsamic Vinegar

Trim asparagus spears to a uniform length. Blanch in boiling water for 3-4 minutes until barely softened. Stop cooking by placing under cold water until cool. Just before serving, arrange in one layer on a cookie sheet. Drizzle lightly with the olive oil, rolling around to coat completely. Place under broiler for 2-3 minutes until warmed and before burning. Remove and sprinkle with Balsamic vinegar, then stack on serving tray.
