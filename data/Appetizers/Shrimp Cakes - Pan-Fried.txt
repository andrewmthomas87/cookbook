Make the sauce: Combine all ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.
Prepare the cakes: Wrap the tofu in paper towels and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. In a large bowl, combine the tofu, shrimp, beef, vermouth, 1 egg, scallion, garlic, sesame oil and seeds (if using), two large pinches of salt and a pinch of pepper. Mix well, using your hands if necessary. Divide the mixture into 8 balls, each roughly one-third cup.
Spread the flour on a small plate. In a shallow bowl, lightly beat the remaining 2 eggs with a few drops of water. Place the ingredients and a paper-towel-lined tray by the stove.
In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until very hot but not smoking. Meanwhile, working with 4 balls, dredge each in flour and coat with the egg. Quickly add the balls to the skillet, flatten them with a spatula to about 3½ inches in diameter and cook until the shrimp turn pink and the coating is golden, about 1½ minutes. Flip the cakes and cook for about 1½ minutes more. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Serve the cakes, two per person, with the dipping sauce. Garnish with the lemon wedges and parsley.
