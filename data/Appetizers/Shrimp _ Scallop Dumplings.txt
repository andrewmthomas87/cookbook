Shrimp & Scallop Dumplings

36 dumplings

½	pound sea scallops, roughly chopped
½	pound shrimp, peeled, cleaned and roughly chopped
1	teaspoon kosher salt
½	teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1	tablespoon grated ginger
⅓	cup chopped scallions
1	teaspoon toasted sesame oil
½	cup chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems, plus a few sprigs for garnish
1	Serrano chili pepper, finely chopped
1	tablespoons peanut oil (or vegetable oil)
¼	cup water
36	round dumpling wrappers

Put chopped scallops and shrimp in a bowl. Add salt, pepper, ginger, scallions, sesame oil, chopped cilantro and Serrano chili pepper. Mix well with a wooden spoon, then cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour. (Mixture may be prepared up to 1 day ahead.) You should have about 2½ cups filling.
Working in batches, line up dumpling wrappers on a work surface. Place 1 teaspoon or so of the filling in the center of each wrapper. Lightly moisten the edge of each wrapper with water and pinch together to surround filling and form a half-moon. Pleat edges to secure the seal. A special Chinese dumpling press (also known as an empanada press) is a handy device for this task.
Heat peanut or vegetable oil in a large skillet until just before smoking. Place dumplings in a single layer (may take multiple passes) and sauté both sides until just beginning to brown, and then add the ¼ cup of water, cover the skillet and steam for 3-4 minutes.
Dumplings can be prepared in advance and individually frozen, then kept in the freezer in a zip-lock bag. In this case, do not thaw them, just place directly in the hot skillet for preparation as above.
Serve with a soy sauce dip and optional hot chili sauce, and garnish with cilantro sprigs.
