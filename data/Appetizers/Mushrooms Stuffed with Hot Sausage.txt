Mushrooms Stuffed with Hot Sausage

24 appetizers

24	medium sized uniform button mushrooms
1	pound fresh hot Italian sausage

Brush mushrooms clean, and then remove stems to leave a smooth cavity in each mushroom. Cut a thin slice from the bottom of each mushroom so they will set squarely on the cookie sheet.
Fill each mushroom cavity amply with the hot sausage and place on aluminum foil on a cookie sheet so they are not touching each other.
Bake at 400F for 10-12 minutes, then broil approximately 3 inches under broiler until the sausage is browned and well cooked. Remove and place on double paper towel, covering with another paper towel to remove grease.
