1	teaspppn sesame oil
½	teaspoon grated ginger
1	teaspoon chopped garlic

Mix all ingredients except the cabbage well, about 3-5 minutes
Wash and dry the Napa cabbage leaves, then use the food processor to chop. Put the chopped cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt. Wait for 10 minutes and use both hands to squeeze the extra liquid out of the cabbage. Put the dry chopped cabbage in to the meat and mix well. You can use cabbage, fresh or frozen spinach, carrots or your favorite vegetable.
Wet the edges of one wonton wrapper with warm water. Place about 1 tablespoon of the meat & cabbage mixture in the center, then double the wrapper over. Press the air out and crimp edges to form a dumpling. Repeat for all additional dumplings.
Boil a pot of water, put 20-25 dumplings in the boiled water and use a wooden spoon to stir gently. Cover until the water boils again. Open the lid and add 1 cup of cold water. Let the water boil again and keep boiling for few more minutes until the dumplings all float. Put the steamed dumpling in the pan with a little peanut oil, and sauté them until beginning to brown on the edges.
