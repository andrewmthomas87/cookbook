8 servings

Soufflés:
6	 egg whites
Béchamel Sauce (recipe follows)
Cream Sauce (recipe follows)
Béchamel Sauce:
¼	cup unsalted butter
½	cup all purpose flour
3	cups milk
3	egg yolks
3	ounces Gruyere cheese
salt and pepper to taste
Cream Sauce:
4	cups heavy cream
3	ounces Gruyere cheese, grated
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

To prepare béchamel sauce: chill eight 4-inch soufflé molds in freezer while preparing béchamel sauce. In a medium saucepan, bring milk to a boil; set aside. In a large heavy- bottomed skillet or sauté pan, melt butter over low heat. Stir in flour and cook 3 minutes, whisking constantly to prevent coloring. Remove from heat and whisk in hot milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Remove from heat and whisk in egg yolks, one by one, mixing well after each addition. Stir in grated cheese. Transfer mixture to a large bowl; set aside. Cover to keep hot.
To prepare cream sauce: in a large heavy-bottomed skillet, heat cream until warm; do not allow to boil. Salt to taste. Set aside and keep warm.
To prepare soufflés: preheat oven to 425F. Beat egg whites with whisk or electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Whisk one-third of egg whites into bowl of prepared béchamel sauce.
Gently fold in the remainder of egg whites with a spatula (must be perfectly blended to ensure smooth consistency). Butter chilled soufflé molds and gently fill each one until piled high. Place filled molds on baking sheet and bake 5 minutes or until tops are nicely browned. Gently turn each soufflé out into prepared skillet of warmed cream sauce. Sprinkle generously with grated cheese and return to oven for an additional 5-6 minutes, then brown lightly under broiler.
To serve: place each soufflé in center of serving dish. Surround with prepared cream sauce from soufflé skillet. Serve immediately.
