Artichoke Puffs

48 Puffs

2	tablespoons unsalted butter
8	ounces button mushrooms, sliced
4	large eggs
1	cup sour cream
½	cup ricotta cheese
1	tablespoon lemon juice
1	cup grated Parmesan cheese
¼	cup all-purpose flour
¼	cup finely minced onion
4	dashes Tabasco sauce
2	cans (14 oz) artichoke hearts, drained and cut into sixths or eighths
1	cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese

Preheat oven to 350F. Grease or spray mini-muffin pan with non-stick vegetable spray.
Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat; add mushrooms, cooking until soft. Set aside to cool.
In a large bowl, mix eggs, sour cream, ricotta cheese, and lemon juice until blended. Add Parmesan cheese, flour, onion, and Tabasco sauce, blending well. Stir in artichoke hearts, cheddar cheese, and sautéed mushrooms, until combined. Scoop into a prepared mini-muffin tin. The cups should be nearly full but not overflowing; do not allow contents from each cup to touch or the puffs will fail to rise. Bake for 19-22 minutes until lightly browned. Let cool slightly and remove from pans.
Note: Artichoke puffs may be prepared a day or two in advance. Store in the refrigerator or freezer. Reheat in a 350F oven 6-7 minutes for refrigerated, or 10-11 minutes for frozen puffs.
