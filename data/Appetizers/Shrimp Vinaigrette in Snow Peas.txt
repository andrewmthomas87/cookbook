approximately 30 appetizers

1	bay leaf
1	pound large shrimp (28 to 30), peeled and deveined
15	to 20 snow peas
1	small green cabbage
Vinaigrette:
Â½	cup olive oil
3	tablespoons white wine vinegar
3	tablespoons Dijon mustard
1	tablespoon chopped shallots
1	teaspoon finely minced ginger
1	clove garlic, finely minced
1	tablespoon chopped dill
Pinch sugar
Salt and pepper to taste

Add one bay leaf to a large pot of water and bring to a rapid boil. Add shrimp and cook, stirring constantly, until just done (2 to 3 minutes). Be sure not to overcook. Drain shrimp, immerse in very cold water to cool, and drain again. Put in glass or steel bowl.
Mix vinaigrette ingredients in a covered jar. Shake well and pour over shrimp. Coat well, cover bowl, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 days, tossing every 12 hours.
String the peas and blanch in boiling water for 30 seconds. Drain and immerse in iced water. Drain again. Split the pods lengthwise so that you have 30 to 40 separate halves.
Cut a thin slice off the bottom of the cabbage so that it will stand upright. Wrap a pea pod around each shrimp and fasten by piercing with a round natural wood toothpick. Then stick each shrimp into the cabbage. Serve cold or at room temperature.
VARIATION: In place of snow peas, wrap each shrimp with a paper-thin piece of prosciutto.
