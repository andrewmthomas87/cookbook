Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese on Toast

approximately 16 appetizer portions

4	ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
2	tablespoon sour cream
1	teaspoon lemon juice
¼	cup of the green end of scallions cut crosswise thinly
4	thin slices of smoked salmon cut into ½ inch by 3 inch strips
4	slices of Brownberry wheat bread, crusts cut off, then quartered

Combine the cream cheese, sour cream, and lemon juice in the bowl of a food processor and blend until the mixture is smooth. Add the scallion ends and mix in easily to avoid chopping. Chill at least 30 minutes.
Cut the crusts off the Brownberry bread slices, then quarter into 16 square pieces. Toast lightly on each side under broiler. Assemble appetizers no more than an hour before serving by spreading the cream cheese mixture on the toasts, then roll one strip of smoked salmon into a rosette and place on top of each toast.
