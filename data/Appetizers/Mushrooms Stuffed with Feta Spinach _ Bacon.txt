Mushrooms stuffed with Feta, Spinach, & Bacon

48 appetizers

8	ounces bacon slices
1	cup chopped onion
1	ten-ounce package of chopped frozen spinach, thawed & squeezed dry
4	ounces feta cheese, crumbled (about ¾ cup)
4	ounces cream cheese, room temperature
¼	teaspoon dried crushed red pepper flakes
3	 pounds button mushrooms (about 48, each about 1½ inches in diameter, stemmed

Preheat oven to 375F. Cook bacon in a heavy large skillet until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain, and then crumble coarsely. Discard all but about one-third cup of the bacon grease, adding olive oil if necessary to reach quantity.
Heat 2 teaspoons of the reserved grease in a heavy medium skillet over medium heart. Add chopped onion and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and cool; mix in bacon, spinach, feta, cream cheese, and crushed red pepper flakes. Season filling to taste with salt and pepper.
Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Toss mushrooms and the rest of the reserved grease in a large bowl to coat. Sprinkle mushrooms with salt & pepper. Place mushrooms, rounded side down, in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake mushrooms until centers fill with liquid, about 25 minutes. Turn mushrooms over and bake until brown and liquid evaporates, about 20 minutes longer. Turn mushrooms over again and spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling into each mushroom cavity.
At this point the mushrooms can be refrigerated one day ahead. If so, preheat oven to 375F and bake stuffed mushrooms until heated through, about 10 minutes.
