Polenta Half-Moons with Whipped Goat Cheese

48 pieces

Polenta:
1	teaspoon kosher salt
1	cup yellow cornmeal
Vegetable oil cooking spray
2	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2	tablespoons finely grated Parmesan
Goat Cheese:
4	ounces goat cheese, at room temperature
3	tablespoons heavy cream, at room temperature
3	tablespoons chopped fresh basil
¼	teaspoon kosher salt
¼	teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
¼	cup pine nuts, toasted

For the polenta: Preheat the broiler. Bring 3 cups water and the salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the cornmeal and continue to stir until the polenta is thick, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer the polenta to a sheet of parchment paper. Roll the polenta into a 2 1/2-diameter log. Refrigerate until cool, 30 minutes.
Spray a heavy baking sheet with vegetable oil cooking spray. Slice the polenta into ⅛ inch-thick slices. Cut each slice of polenta in half to make half-moon shapes and arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with the olive oil and sprinkle with the Parmesan. Broil until the cheese is golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes.
For the goat cheese: Beat the goat cheese, cream, basil, salt and pepper in a medium bowl using an electric hand mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 minute. Stir in the pine nuts.
Using two spoons to measure, place ½ to ¾ teaspoon-size dollops of the goat cheese mixture on top of the polenta slices and serve.
