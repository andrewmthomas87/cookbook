Smoked Salmon Mousse on Cucumber Rounds

approximately 40 appetizers

8	ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
2	ounces smoked salmon
a few drops of lemon juice
2	or 3 tablespoons heavy cream
White pepper to taste
2	seedless English cucumbers
Garnish:
Watercress leaf (optional)

Combine the mousse ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and blend until the mixture is smooth. Chill at least 30 minutes. Cut each cucumber crosswise into approximately 20 slices, each slightly less than Â¼ inch thick. Cucumbers can also be peeled, striated with fork tines, or cut into decorative shapes with biscuit cutters. Assemble appetizers no more than an hour before serving by softening the mousse with a wooden spoon and putting it in a pastry bag with a leaf tip. Pipe mousse on top of each cucumber slice, and garnish each with a small watercress leaf.
