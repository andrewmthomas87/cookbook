6 servings

1 ounce (about) mild blue cheese (such as Maytag)
24	pitted Spanish olives, patted dry
Peanut oil (for frying)
All purpose flour
1	large egg, beaten to blend
Â½	cup fine dry breadcrumbs

Roll small amount of cheese into log shape narrow enough to stuff into 1 pitted olive; stuff olive with cheese. Repeat with remaining olives and cheese. (DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Pour enough oil into heavy large skillet to measure depth of 1 inch. Heat oil to 350F. Roll stuffed olives in flour, then in egg, then in breadcrumbs to coat. Fry olives until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Using slotted spoon, transfer olives to paper towels to drain. Serve hot.
