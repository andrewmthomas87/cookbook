Zucchini Fritters

4 servings

1	pound tender spring zucchini
1	tablespoon flour
Coarse salt
1	egg, lightly beaten
1	clove garlic
2	tablespoons olive oil
1	small bunch chives

Sweat: Grate and lightly salt zucchini. Tumble into a colander and let sweat (over sink or plate), 30 minutes. Squeeze dry with strong hands or clean kitchen towel. Turn into a medium mixing bowl.
Chop: Finely chop garlic. Finely chop chives; measure out 1 tablespoon. Finely chop zest.
Mix: Use a fork to gently stir garlic, chives, zest, flour and egg into drained zucchini.
Crisp: Heat olive oil in a medium skillet set over medium heat. Scoop up a heaping tablespoon of batter and settle it into the pan. It will flatten into a diminutive green-flecked pancake. Add additional pancakes, but donâ€™t crowd. Crisp golden, 3 minutes. Flip and crisp reverse, 2 more minutes. Lift out with a spatula and let rest on a paper-towel padded baking sheet while cooking remaining fritters. Serve
