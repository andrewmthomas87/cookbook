Crostini with Tomatoes & Arugula

12 servings

1	pound fresh ripe plum tomatoes
12	medium-size fresh basil leaves
2	tablespoons fresh oregano leaves
1	medium bunch of arugula (3 ounces)
1	baguette
Salt
3	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat broiler.
Peel the tomatoes, remove seeds, and cut into ½-inch dice. Place in a mixing bowl.
Coarsely chop the basil and oregano leaves and add them to the tomatoes. Trim the arugula stems, rince and dry the leaves, coarsely shred them and add to the bowl.
Cut 12 slices of the baguette on a diagonal about ½-inch thick, place on a baking sheet and put under the broiler. Broil the bread until it becomes lightly browned – 2-3 minutes – then turn the slices over and brown the second side as well.
Season the tomato mixture with salt, add the olive oil and toss well. Spread the tomato mixture over the bread and serve.
