3	cups chicken broth

2	bay leaves
1	teaspoon whole black peppercorns
½	teaspoonsalt
8	bacon slices (about ½ pound)

Preheat oven to 325F. Cut off and discard upper stalks of fennel, including feathery leaves. Remove wilted outer layer of stalks, cut off a thin slice from base. Wash; cut bulbs in half lengthwise.
In a 3-quart rectangular baking dish combine chicken broth, wine, garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Add fennel. Sprinkle with salt. Cover and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour or until fennel is tender when pricked with a fork. Remove fennel from liquid and cool; discard liquid mixture.
Wrap a bacon slice around each baked fennel half to cover. Place bacon-wrapped fennel halves in a 15”x10” baking pan. Bake, uncovered, for about 45 minutes or until bacon is crisp and browned, brushing fennel occasionally with bacon drippings. Serve one fennel half per person sprinkled with chopped roasted red bell peppers and parsley.
