Arugula & Prosciutto Pizza

one 12 x 18 inch pizza

1	ten ounce refrigerated pizza dough
1	clove garlic, minced
2	tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
¾	cup grated mozzarella cheese
¾	cup grated fontina cheese
6	cups arugula leaves, ends trimmed
8	thin slices of prosciutto, chopped into 1 inch squares
1	medium tomato, seeded and chopped (or 8-10 cherry tomatoes, halved)

Position rack in bottom third of oven; pre-heat to 425F. Lightly oil a 12”x18” baking sheet. Unroll the dough on to floured surface and sprinkle with flour. Roll out to fill the baking sheet and stretch to all four edges, leaving a bit of extra dough around the edges. Mix the minced garlic and olive oil and brush the dough; then bake for 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Sprinkle the dough with olive oil again when it comes out.
Mix the mozzarella and fontina cheeses well, then sprinkle evenly over the partially baked dough. Bake for 8-10-15 minutes, or until the cheeses are completely melted. Meanwhile mix the arugula leaves, chopped prosciutto and tomatoes in together a large bowl. Remove the pizza from the oven and top evenly with the mixture. Return to the oven briefly to warm all the ingredients.
Allow to cool for 3-5 minutes, then cut into 2 inch squares and serve on a platter.
