3	tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves
12	slices deli provolone cheese
2	medium tomatoes, thinly sliced

Preheat the oven to 400F.
Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface.  Cut the pastry sheets into 18 squares along the fold marks. Place the pastry rectangles onto a baking sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown. Remove the pastries from the baking sheet and let cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
Heat the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and cook until tender and the liquid is evaporated. Add the tomatoes, then stir in the basil.
Place 6 bottom pastry layers onto a baking sheet.  Divide half of the mushrooms among the bottom pastry layers, then top each with a slice of tomato, then a slice of provolone cheese. Add a second pastry layer, followed by the other half of the mushroom mixture and a slice of provolone cheese and a slice of tomato. Top with pastry layers.  Bake for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted, then sprinkle each with some chopped chives and serve on top of some arugula.
