Blend the first 5 ingredients in a food processor. Coarsely chop half of the smoked salmon and add to cheese mixture; process until well blended. Season with salt and pepper. Cut the remaining salmon into 6 equal strips. (Cheese mixture and salmon strips can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separate and chill.)

Arrange bell pepper, cucumber, watercress and green onions atop the salmon strip, dividing equally. Roll up pita rounds tightly. Wrap in plastic; chill until firm, at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.
Trim ends of roulades. Cut each roulade into ¾ inch-wide pieces.
