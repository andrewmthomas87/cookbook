Tomato Vodka Gel Mold

8 servings

3	pounds tomatoes
2	scallions, minced
¼	cup olive oil
salt & pepper
juice of 1 lemon
½	cup vodka
2	envelopes gelatin

Preheat oven to 400F. Peel tomatoes, place in a baking dish and drizzle with olive oil, salt & pepper to taste. Roast in oven for 20 minutes.
Puree tomatoes in a food processor, add the minced scallions, lemon juice & vodka and simmer in a saucepan over medium heat for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the gelatin. Lightly coat a round mold with olive oil and pour in mixture to the top of the mold. Refrigerate until set, usually about 3 hours, or overnight.
Un-mold by first submerging the mold in hot water for about 10 seconds, being careful not to get the top of the mold underwater. Place a large serving plate upside down on top of the mold, then carefully invert and remove mold. If the tomato gel doesn't release, gently shake the plate and the mold as a unit until it releases.
Serve with basil leaves, olives, and small balls of mozzarella cheese surrounding the tomato gel and arugula or other salad greens in the center.
