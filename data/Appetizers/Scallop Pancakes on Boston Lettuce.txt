Scallop Pancakes on Boston Lettuce

4 servings (12 pancakes)

Pancakes:
¼	pound scallops, rinsed under cold water to remove any sand
½	cup all-purpose flour
¼	teaspoon baking powder
1 1/3 cups club soda
¼	teaspoon salt
¼	teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1	tablespoon minced fresh chives
3	tablespoons peanut oil
Boston Lettuce Salad:
2	to 3 cups torn Boston lettuce, washed and dried
1	tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1½	teaspoons fresh lemon juice
Dash each with salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the pancakes: Put the scallops, flour, baking powder, club soda, salt, and pepper in a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Stir in the chives.
Heat about 1½ tablespoons of the peanut oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Spoon about 1½ tablespoons batter per pancake into the pan. It will spread to form a disk about 3 ½ inches in diameter. Cook about 6 pancakes at a time over medium heat for a total of about 5 minutes, turning them after about 2½ minutes. Repeat with the remaining 1½ tablespoons oil and the remaining batter to make about 12 pancakes total. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving.
For the salad: Toss the lettuce with the olive oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper in a medium bowl. To serve, divide the salad among four plates, arrange 3 pancakes alongside or on top of the greens, and serve.
