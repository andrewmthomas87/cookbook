Crab Newburg á la Cross Creek Appetizers

100 appetizers

6	tablespoons unsalted butter
1	pound crabmeat, approximately 2 cups
2	tablespoons all-purpose flour or instant flour
1½	cups heavy cream
2	tablespoons lemon juice (or juice of 1 lemon)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
Pinch of ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika, or to taste
Pinch of cayenne pepper, or to taste
½	cup dry sherry
3	eggs
1	tablespoon brandy
1	tablespoon parsley, finely chopped

In a large, heavy skillet set over medium heat, melt the butter but do not allow it to brown. Add the crabmeat and stir gently. Cook for one minute, then sprinkle flour over the top and stir gently to incorporate. Cook for another minute or so, then add cream slowly, stirring gently, followed by lemon juice. When sauce is smooth and beginning to thicken, add salt, pepper, cloves, paprika and cayenne pepper and stir to combine. Add sherry and stir again.
In a small bowl, whisk the eggs until they are almost foaming, then add to the hot crab mixture and stir to combine. Add the brandy, garnish with parsley.
Prepare a sheet of Pepperidge Farm puff pastry by thawing, then rolling flat to a square of about 15 inches. Cut into squares of 1.5 inches, then bake at 400F for about 10 minutes or until browned.
Place a dollop of the crab mix on each puff pastry square and serve immediately.
