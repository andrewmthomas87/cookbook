Scallops Wrapped in Spinach

24 pieces

1½	pounds fresh spinach leaves, stems removed
¾	pounds sea or bay scallops
½	cup diced Jicama in ⅛ inch dice
2	scallions, minced
2	tablespoons lemon juice
1	tablespoon lemon zest
1	tablespoon minced ginger root
salt & freshly ground black pepper
2	tablespoons olive oil
1	cup sake or dry sherry
½	cup water

Wash spinach leaves in several changes of cold water. Blanch leaves 5 seconds in lightly salted boiling water; plunge into cold water to stop cooking so leaves retain their color. Drain on paper towels. Select 24 whole unblemished leaves.
Trim away any tough muscle from scallops. If using sea scallops, cut into ⅓ inch cubes; leave bay scallops whole. Combine the scallops, diced jicama, scallions, half of the lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice and ginger in a large bowl. Let stand 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
Arrange spinach leaves, smooth side down, on work surface. Put about 1½ tablespoons of the scallop mixture on each leaf and roll up, folding in sides like an envelope. Place rolls on a baking sheet; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 to 3 hours.
Whisk together the olive oil and the remaining lemon zest and lemon juice; set aside. Pour the sake and ½ cup of water into the bottom of a steamer; heat to simmer. Place scallop rolls in steamer; steam, covered, for 2 minutes. Turn off heat; uncover. Brush rolls with the reserved oil-lemon mixture. Transfer to a warm serving platter and serve hot.
