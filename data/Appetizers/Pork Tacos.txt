Heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, thyme, oregano, and bay leaves; season with salt and pepper. Cook until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste. Add pork, tomatoes (breaking them up) and their juice, chipotle, and 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until the meat is very tender, 2 to 2½ hours. Discard bay leaves.
Using tongs transfer the meat to a large bowl; shred with two forks, discarding nay large pieces of fat or gristle. Return meat to pan and simmer until the sauce is thick, 30 to 40 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper if necessary. Proceed to next step or cover and refrigerate 1 day.
Combine the vinegar, sesame oil, honey, ½ teaspoon of the salt and ¼ teaspoon of the pepper in a medium mixing bowl. Put the cabbage, red onion, and scallions in a very large mixing bowl and season with the remaining black pepper and cayenne. Add the dressing mixture and rice noodles, then toss and store in the refrigerator in large plastic storage bags for at least four hours.
Spoon pork and sauce into toasted tortillas, using 2 tortillas for each serving; top with queso fresco and cilantro and serve with crunchy slaw.
