Buckwheat Blini with Smoked Salmon

12 pieces

¼	cup all-purpose flour
3	tablespoons buckwheat flour
1	tablespoon minced fresh dill
½	teaspoon salt
Freshly ground pepper
½	cup beer, at room temperature
2	tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1	egg, separated
Toppings:
½	red onion, thinly sliced
4	ounces very thinly sliced smoked salmon, cut into 2-inch squares
¼	cup sour cream
1	tablespoon minced fresh dill plus fres dill sprigs
Freshly ground pepper

Heat the oven to lowest setting. For blini, combine the flours, dill, salt and pepper to taste in a medium bowl. Add the beer, melted butter and egg yolk, stirring gently just until a batter forms; set aside.
Beat the egg white with an electric mixer on high speed until it forms stiff peaks; gently fold the egg white into the batter with a whisk until just incorporated.
Heat a heavy, non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Pour the batter onto the skillet with a 2-ounce ladle to form 3-inch pancakes, taking care not to overcrowd the skillet. Cook until browned, 2-3 minutes. Turn with a spatula; cook until the other side browns, 1-2 minutes. Transfer the blini to a baking sheet large enough to hold them in a single layer; keep warm in the oven while you cook any remaining batter.
Arrange a thin layer of red onion on each blini. Top with a salmon square; spoon a little sour cream on top & roll the salmon into a tube. Sprinkle with minced dill; grind a little black pepper over the blini. Garnish with fresh dill sprigs.
