48 pieces

1	sixteen ounce package square wonton skins
Salad:
⅓	cup low-sodium chicken broth
Zest of 1/4 large orange
Juice of 1/2 large orange (about 3 tablespoons fresh orange juice)
¾	teaspoon ground cumin
⅓	cup couscous
One 11-ounce can mandarin oranges in light syrup, drained & chopped
¼	cup slivered almonds, toasted and chopped
2	tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Dressing:
1	tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1	tablespoon fresh orange juice
1	tablespoon red wine vinegar
¾	teaspoon kosher salt
¼	teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

For the pastry cups: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400F. Spray a 48-count nonstick mini-muffin pan with vegetable oil cooking spray. Cut wonton skins into quarters & press the dough into the prepared muffin cups. Bake until light golden, 10 minutes. Cool completely before filling, 15 minutes.
For the salad: Bring the broth, orange zest, orange juice and cumin to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the couscous and remove the pan from the heat. Cover the pan until the liquid had been absorbed and the couscous is tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Fluff the couscous and break up any lumps, using a fork. Toss together the couscous, mandarin oranges, almonds and parsley in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
For the dressing: Whisk together the oil, orange juice, vinegar, salt and pepper in a small bowl until smooth. To assemble: Pour the dressing over the salad and toss until coated. Spoon the mixture into the cooled pastry cups and serve.
