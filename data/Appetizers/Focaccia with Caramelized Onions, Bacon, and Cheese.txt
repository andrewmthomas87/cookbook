Focaccia with Caramelized Onions, Bacon & Cheese

6-8 servings

For crust:
½	package active dry yeast
½	teaspoon sugar
½	cup plus 1 tablespoon warm water (105-115 degrees)
1⅓	cups bread flour
¼	cup plus 1 tablespoon rolled oasts
1½	teaspoon safflower oil
For topping:
2	tablespoons butter
2	medium onions, thinly sliced
¼	teaspoon salt
5	slices bacon, cooked crisp, blotted, and coarsely crumbled
Freshly ground pepper
1½	cups shredded Fontina cheese
2	tablespoons julienne of fresh basil leaves

For crust, stir yeast and sugar into water; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Combine flour, oats, oil, and salt in food processor. Add yeast mixture through feed tube while machine is running. Stop processor and check texture of dough, which should be moist to the touch. If too dry, add more water; if too wed, add more four. Process until dough is uniformly moist and elastic, about 40 seconds more.
Transfer to a large plastic food bag, seal at top and let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour.
For topping, melt butter in a medium skillet. Add onions; cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until soft, 8-10 minutes. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring often, until golden, 2-3 minutes. Season with ¼ teaspoon salt and set aside.
Punch dough down, place on a floured board; roll into a free-form shape about 14 inches square, about ½ to ¼ inch thick. Oil large baking pan; sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon rolled oats. Transfer dough to pan. Evenly spread onions over crust, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, add bacon and cheese, sprinkling evenly.
Heat oven to 425F. Bake until bottom of crust is golden brown, about 18-20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; sprinkle with basil. Cut into squares; serve immediately.
