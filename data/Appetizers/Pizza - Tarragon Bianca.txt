Pizza - Tarragon Bianca

8 appetizer servings

1	ten ounce refrigerated pizza dough tube (Pillsbury)
Extra-virgin olive oil
4	tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
1½	cups (packed) mozzarella cheese, grated
1	medium fennel bulb, trimmed & very thinly sliced
1	zucchini, very thinly sliced
1	yellow squash, very thinly sliced
¼	cup minced scallions, white and green parts
4	ounces Brie cheese, rind removed, cut into ½ inch cubes

Position rack in bottom third of oven; pre-heat to 425F. Lightly oil a 12”x13” baking sheet. Unroll the dough on to floured surface and sprinkle with flour. Roll out to fill the baking sheet and stretch to all four edges, leaving a bit of extra dough around the edges. Brush lightly with olive oil; sprinkle with the minced scallions and bake for 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Sprinkle the dough with olive oil again when it comes out.
Thoroughly mix the sliced and minced vegetables and the chopped tarragon with the mozzarella cheese. Place this mixture on the partially baked pizza dough and spread evenly to the edges. Place the cubes of Brie cheese evenly on top of the pizza. It will be reasonably thick, but will flatten when baked. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the mozzarella and Brie cheese are completely melted.
Allow to cool for 5-10 minutes, then cut into 2 inch squares and serve on a platter.
