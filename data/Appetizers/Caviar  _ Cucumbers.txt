Cucumber Slices with Caviar

12-15 pieces

One or two fresh English cucumbers (seedless)
2	ounce jar of Romanoff Black Whitefish caviar

Peel all of the green skin off the cucumbers, and then slice into ⅛ to ¼ inch slices. This can be done in advance. Just before serving place about ½ teaspoon of the black caviar in the center of each cucumber slice and serve on a doily-lined tray. If the caviar is put on too early it will run and discolor the cucumber slices. For variety, red caviar can be used also.
