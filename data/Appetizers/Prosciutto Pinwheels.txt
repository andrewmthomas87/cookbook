Prosciutto Pinwheels

10-12 servings

1	box (2 sheets) Pepperidge Farms frozen puff pastry, thawed
¾	cup Dijon mustard, divided into two halves
24	slices prosciutto, very thinly sliced & divided into two halves
24	slices provolone, thinly sliced & divided into two halves

Preheat oven to 425F. Place parchment baking paper on large baking sheet & grease lightly. Working with one sheet of the puff pastry, keeping remaining sheet wrapped and cool, roll out on lightly floured surface to 15-inch square. Brush with thin layer of mustard. Cover with half of the prosciutto slices, slightly overlapping and leaving ½ inch border around edges.
Layer with the slices of provolone cheese. Roll pastry tightly, from the long side. Pinch seams to seal and tuck ends under. Repeat with remaining pastry sheet. Cut into ½ inch pieces and place, cut side up, 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheet. Bake 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.
