Nachos - Greek Style

4 servings

4	pita pockets, white or whole wheat, cut into wedges
½	cup olive oil
Salt
4	ounces feta cheese
½	cup yogurt, preferably whole-milk
½	cup chopped fresh mint
1	lemon
Freshly ground black pepper
1	medium onion, chopped
½	pound ground lamb
1	tablespoon ground cumin
2	or 3 medium ripe tomatoes, chopped
1	medium cucumber, peeled and seeded if necessary, and chopped
½	cup Kalamata olives, pitted and halved (optional).

Preheat oven to 350F. Arrange pita wedges in one layer on baking sheets and brush or drizzle with a tablespoon or two of olive oil. Bake until they begin to color, turning once or twice, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with salt, turn off oven and put chips back in to keep warm.
In a blender or food processor, combine feta, yogurt, ¼ cup olive oil, mint and zest and juice of lemon; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Blend or process until smooth. (You can also mash mixture by hand, with a fork.)
Put two tablespoons of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook onions until soft, about 5 minutes. Add lamb and cumin and sprinkle with salt and pepper; continue cooking until meat is cooked through, about 5 to 10 minutes more. Put chips on a serving plate and top with lamb, sauce, tomatoes, cucumbers and olives if you’re using them.
