Bake the wonton cups for 5 minutes until they are lightly browned; then remove them from the oven and set them aside.
Add the vegetable oil to a medium sauté pan set over medium-low heat. Add the ground meat and cook it, breaking it apart with a spatula, until it is browned and cooked through. Add the taco seasoning and stir to combine then remove the pan from the heat.
