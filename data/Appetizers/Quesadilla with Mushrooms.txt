Quesadilla with Mushrooms

24 servings

8	corn tortillas
2	cups grated cheese (queso blanco, Monterey jack or, jalapeno jack)
8	ounces crimini mushrooms, slice thinly
½	cup fresh or frozen sweet corn kernels
1	small red onion, sliced thinly
1	cloves garlic, minced
2	cups blanched Swiss chard, chopped
2	tablespoons butter
2	tablespoons olive oil

Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Place one tablespoon each of the butter and olive oil in the skillet. When the butter is melted, add the onions, garlic, corn, and mushrooms. Sauté for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Add the Swiss Chard and continue cooking until the chard is wilted. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the grated cheese.
Heat another large skillet over medium-high heat, then melt another tablespoon of butter. Before the butter browns, place as many tortillas as will fit flat in the pan and sauté until one side begins to brown. Flip and cook the other side for the same length of time. Repeat until all 8 tortillas are browned.
Lay each tortilla on a flat surface and spoon the vegetable & cheese mixture over half, then fold the other half on top and press together. Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and lightly oil with olive oil. Lightly brush one side of the prepared quesadillas with olive oil and place on the cookie sheet, brushed side up. Bake until the tortillas are browned, approximately 10 minutes.
Cut each tortilla into 3 wedge shaped pieces, then arrange six pieces in a circle around a dollop of sour cream. Serve with a small dish of salsa on the side.
