Pot Stickers

24 appetizers

Â½	pound ground lean pork
1	onion, finely chopped
1	cup finely shredded green cabbage
2	teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger
1	tablespoon Asian sesame oil
1	tablespoon soy sauce
1	teaspoon white pepper
24	round wheat wonton wrappers
4	tablespoons vegetable oil
2	cups chicken stock, or as needed
Light soy sauce for serving

In a bowl, combine pork, oinion, cabbage, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce and pepper. Mix well.
Place wonton wrappers on work surface and cover with damp kitchen towel. Working with one wrapper at a time, lay it on work surface and place 1 teaspoon filling in middle. Brush edges with water, fold wonton in half and press edges together to seal. Using your fingertips, pinch frill around each folded wonton if desired. Set aside, covered with plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining wrappers.
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Swirl to cover entire bottom of pan. Working in batches, fry filled wontons until golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute. Coat pan as needed with remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil.
Return pot stickers to pan and add enough stock to come halfway up the sides of pot stickers. Cover and simmer until stock is almost absorbed, about 10 minutes. Uncover and cook until stock is completely absorbed and bottoms of pot stickers are crisp. Repeat with remaining pot stickers.
Serve pot stickers warm with soy sauce.
