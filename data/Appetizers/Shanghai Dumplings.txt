⅓	cup finely chopped green onions (white parts only)

2	tablespoons soy sauce
1	large garlic clove, minced

Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Place one dumpling wrapper on work surface. Spoon one very generous teaspoon filling onto center of wrapper, including at least 2 or 3 aspic cubes. Lightly brush edges of dumpling each wrapper with water. Bring one corner of the wrapper up around the filling, then pleat remaining edges of wrapper at regular intervals all around filling until filling is enclosed and wrapper forms bundle-like shape with small opening at top.
Gather top edges of wrapper together and twist at top to enclose filling. Place on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. DO AHEAD Can be refrigerated, covered, for 1 day, or frozen in single layer in covered containers for 2 weeks.
Prepare the steamer. Line each layer of bamboo steamer basket with cabbage leaves; place over wok filled with enough water to reach just below bottom of bamboo steamer basket. (Or line metal steamer rack with cabbage leaves and set over water in large pot.) Place dumplings atop cabbage, spacing apart.
Steam the dumplings. Bring water to boil. Cover; steam until cooked through, adding more water to wok if evaporating too quickly, about 12 minutes for fresh dumplings and 15 minutes for frozen. Serve dumplings immediately
