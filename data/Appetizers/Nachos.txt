Nachos

16 nachos

16	tortilla rounds
½	can refried beans
4	ounces pepperjack cheese
jalapeño slices

Arrange 16 perfect tortilla rounds (Mission or Trader Joe’s) on a large flat microwaveable plate. With a spatula cover each tortilla round with about 1 tablespoon of the refried beans. Place one large or two or three small jalapeño slices on the refried beans. Cut ½ of an eight-ounce piece of pepperjack cheese into eight slices, and then cut the slices in half. Place one pepperjack piece on top of each nacho. Microwave the plate for 2.5 or 3 minutes until the cheese is completely melted, but not bubbling off the nachos. Cool slightly and serve.
