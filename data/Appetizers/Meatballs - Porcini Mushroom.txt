Meatballs with Porcini Mushrooms

6 servings

2	ounces dried porcini mushrooms
½	pound ground veal
½	pound ground pork
1	teaspoon salt
½	teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
2	teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon
1	egg
Olive oil

Place the dried porcini mushrooms in a heatproof bowl. Bring 2 cups water to a boil. Pour water over the porcini and let soak for 10-20 minutes. Strain the soaking liquid, reserving it for another use. Finely chop porcini and mix, using your hands, with the veal, the pork, salt & pepper, tarragon, and the egg.
Using your palms, form 1-inch round meatballs. Set them on a plate near the stove. Generously coat the` bottom of a large sauté pan with the olive oil. Place over high heat, then when it is hot, place the meatballs in the pan, about 1 inch apart. Sauté until brown, then turn them, browning on all sides. Adjust heat so meatballs brown, but do not burn before cooking through. Drain on paper towels, then serve warm or at room temperature. Makes about 40 meatballs.
