Cheese Puffs

40 puffs

2	ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano
1	tablespoon paprika
1	cup water
½	teaspoon salt
8	tablespoons (1 stick) butter, sliced
Pinch nutmeg
1½	cups all-purpose flour
7	extra-large eggs
1	egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash

In a saucepan, combine the water, salt, and butter and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat just until the butter melts. Add the flour all at once. Stir with a wooden spoon for about 2 minutes, or until the mixture forms a cohesive mass and pulls away from the sides of the pan, leaving a white film of flour on the pan sides.
Transfer the dough to a mixer bowl and work it with the paddle for about 1 minute, or until it has cooled slightly. Then work in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Check the consistency of the batter by pulling a wooden spoon through it. When the groove it makes slowly closes in on itself, you have added enough eggs. Alternatively, the batter is ready if it droops from the spoon when it is held sideways. It must be stiff enough to hold its shape when it is piped or spooned onto a sheet pan. Add more eggs one half at a time as needed t o achieve this consistency. Use the dough right away.
Preheat the oven to 500F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Grate the cheese; you should have about 1 cup when lightly pressed. Reserve ¼ cup of the cheese, and work the remaining ¾ cup into the pastry with a wooden spoon, then work the paprika into the pastry.
Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large plain round tip. Pipe in mounds 1 inch wide and ¾ inch high onto the baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart. (You can also use 2 spoons to scoop out the mixture and shape the puffs with damp fingers.) Brush the top of each puff lightly with egg wash, smoothing the tops with the brush. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown outside but still soft inside.
