Chinese Pearl Balls

about 36 appetizers

1	cup glutinous rice
1	pound pork, ground
1	green onion, finely chopped
6	Shitake mushrooms
½	cup water chestnuts, finely chopped
1 	egg, lightly beaten
1	thumb-sized fresh ginger root, peeled and finely minced
½	teaspoon sugar
1	tablespoon soy sauce
Dipping Sauce Ingredients:
½	cup soy sauce
2	tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1	teaspoon sesame oil
1	teaspoon chili garlic sauce
1	teaspoon minced scallions
¼	teaspoon sugar

Soak glutinous rice in enough water to cover for 4 hours. Drain well and using paper towels, pat grains dry. Set aside.
Discard shitake mushroom stems and chop the caps finely.
In a bowl, combine all ingredients except the rice. Form around a teaspoonful of meat mixture into 1-inch quinelles.
Spread rice in a wide dish or in a baking sheet. Roll meat balls, one at a time, in the bed of rice grains, coating them completely with the grains. Arrange coated balls on a wax-lined sheet. At this stage they can be refrigerated or frozen for later use.
Set up steamer with water. Bring around 1-inch of water into a boil. Arrange balls on a plate that will comfortably fit in steamer, or, alternatively, layer cabbage leaves on steamer rack and arrange pearl balls on top of leaves. Cover and steam until rice and meat are cooked, around 30 minutes. Serve with soy sauce.
