Ricotta Polpettes in Sauce

25-30 Polpettes

1	cup ricotta cheese (part skim)
½	cup grated pecorino cheese
1	large egg
1	cup Alfredo sauce or marinara sauce
Handful of fresh sliced basil
Sea salt and white pepper to taste

Drain the ricotta over a fine-mesh sieve for at least an hour.
Meanwhile, start making your Alfredo or marinara sauce (the picture shows only the marinara sauce).
Once drained, put the ricotta in a large bowl with the finely grated pecorino cheese, and egg; then season with salt, and white pepper.
Start working the ingredients together with your hands and season more to taste.
Form the balls with a melon baller, adding them to the pan of sauce. Let them cook in the simmering sauce for about 10 minutes (don’t forget to sway the pan from time to time to ensure the polpette get cooked through evenly).
When ready to serve, add the sliced basil to the sauce and dish it up.
