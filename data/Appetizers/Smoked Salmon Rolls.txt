Smoked Salmon Rolls

approximately 16 appetizer portions

12	thin slices of smoked salmon
8	ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
2	tablespoons sour cream
1	teaspoon lemon juice
¼	cup of the green end of scallions cut crosswise thinly
1	tablespoon tomato paste
¼	cup black olives, chopped thinly
¼	cup sun-dried tomatoes chopped
½	teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½	teaspoon salt
arugula leaves for serving.

Combine the cream cheese, sour cream, and lemon juice in the bowl of a food processor and blend until the mixture is smooth. Add the scallion ends and mix in easily to avoid chopping. Chill at least 30 minutes.
Combine the tomato paste, the black olives, the sun-dried tomatoes, the salt and pepper and mix into a paste.
Overlap 3 slices of the salmon lengthwise on a piece of plastic wrap. Then overlap 3 more slices to form an 8-inch-long piece 4-5 inches wide. Repeat to form a second 8-inch long piece.
Spread half of the cream cheese mixture lengthwise on all but 1 inch of each of the salmon pieces. Spread half of the other mixture over the cheese on each of the salmon pieces. Roll up carefully, closing the length with the uncoated salmon. Tap the ends of each roll to square, then refrigerate several hours or overnight.
When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and cut through with a knife at ¼-inch intervals to make bite-sized rounds. Serve on a bed of arugula leaves.
