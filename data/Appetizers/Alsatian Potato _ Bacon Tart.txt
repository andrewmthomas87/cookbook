Alsatian Potato & Bacon Tart

24 pieces

6	ounces thick-cut bacon, cut into ¼ inch pieces
1	medium onion, thinly sliced
1	medium backing potato, peeled & coarsely sliced
1	tablespoon olive oil
2	teaspoons sherry vinegar
2	teaspoons snipped chives
1	teaspoon chopped fresh sage
salt & freshly ground black pepper
½	pound prepared pizza or bread dough, thawed if frozen
½	cup crème fraiche (¼ cup sour cream mixed with ¼ cup whipping cream)
¼	teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

Preheat the oven to 500F. In a large heavy skillet, cook the bacon over moderate heat until lightly browned around the edges, about 3 minutes, then place on paper towels to remove grease. Add the onion to the skillet and cook over moderate heat until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the potato and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes; add a little water to the pan if the potato begins to stick. Stir in the vinegar, chives, and sage, and season with salt and pepper; remove from the heat.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a 10”x13” rectangle. Transfer to a lightly floured baking sheet, stretching it back into the rectangle.
Stir the crème fraiche and nutmeg into the potato mixture and spread it over the dough, leaving a ½ inch border all around. Scatter the bacon on top. Bake the tart for 12 minutes, or until the edges are browned. Cut into small squares and serve hot. (Can be baked earlier in the day and reheated for serving).
