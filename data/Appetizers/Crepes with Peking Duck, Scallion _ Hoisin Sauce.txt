unknown

48	Basic Crepes – 3 inches in diameter
1	Peking Duck from SunWah – sliced into thin pieces less than ¼ inch thick and about 1½ inches in diameter
3	packages scallions, slice 2 inches on diagonal hoisin sauce
Basic Crepe Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3	large eggs, beaten
1½	cups whole milk
¼	teaspoon salt
4	tablespoons melted unsalted butter

Whisk together the flour, eggs, milk, salt, and 3 tablespoons of the butter to form a smooth, thin batter. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before proceeding.
Heat the iron grill over two burners on low high heat. When hot, brush with a light coating of the remaining butter. Ladle 1 tablespoon of crepe batter into the grill and repeat 12 times. Cook crepes until golden brown on the bottom and the top begins to look dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Using a spatula, carefully turn the crepes and cook on the second side just until the bottom colors slightly, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with waxed paper to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter four times to create 48 crepes.
Assembly:
Put ½ teaspoon of hoisin sauce on a crepe, followed by one piece of Peking duck and one piece of scallion. Roll crepe around ingredients into a cone and secure with a toothpick.  Arrange appetizers on serving tray with an arugula garnish.
