Calzones – Mini Antipasto

12 mini calzones

Flour, for dusting
One 1-pound ball pizza dough
Cornmeal, for dusting
½	cup (4 ounces) shredded fontina cheese
½	cup (4 ounces) shredded provolone
1	ounce salami, diced into ¼ i	inch pieces
¼	cup diced roasted red pepper
1	tablespoon finely chopped kalamata olives (about 5 olives)
1	egg
Marinara sauce (jarred or homemade), warmed, for dipping

Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400F.
On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough ball into a 14-inch circle, about ¼ inch thick. Using a 4-inch round cutter, cut the dough into 12 circles. Transfer the circles onto two heavy baking sheets dusted with cornmeal.
In a medium bowl, combine the fontina, provolone, salami, peppers and olives. In a separate small bowl, beat together the egg and 1 teaspoon water. Place 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture onto 1 half of each dough circle, leaving a ¼-inch border at the edge. With a pastry brush, lightly brush the edges of the dough with the beaten egg. Fold the unfilled half of the dough over the filling and, using the tines of a fork, press the edges together to seal. Repeat with the remaining circles of dough.
Brush the calzones with the remaining egg mixture. Bake for 14 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through, or until the calzones are golden brown. Serve the calzones on a platter with warm marinara sauce for dipping.
To make shredding the fontina easier, freeze it for 15 to 20 minutes.
