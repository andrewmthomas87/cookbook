Calypso Shrimp Skewers

about 30 appetizers

⅓	cup honey
1	teaspoon grated fresh ginger
⅔	cup shredded coconut
⅔	cup finely chopped peanuts
12	ounces medium shrimp, deveined
3	ounces of thinly sliced prosciutto, cut lengthwise into ½-inch wide strips
7	ounces crème fraiche
1	teaspoon grated lime zest
lime juice

Soak about thirty 6-inch wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a shallow dish, combine the honey and ginger and set aside. Combine the coconut and peanuts in another shallow dish and set aside. Drain skewers. Thread shrimp lengthwise on the skewers, beginning at the tail end, until they are straight. Brush each shrimp with the honey mixture, coating completely, then roll in the coconut mixture. Wrap a strip of prosciutto around each shrimp.
Place the shrimp on the skewers either on the grill or under the broiler and cook for 4 to 6 minutes, or until golden brown and the shrimp turn opaque.
In a small bowl, stir together the crème fraiche, lime zest, and enough lime juice to make a good dip. Serve with the shrimp on the skewers placed around a bowl of the sauce.
