Mushroom Pate

20 appetizers

1	ounce dried porcini mushrooms
1½	cups chicken broth, heated
½	stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter
4	shallots, sliced
2	cloves garlic, sliced
2	tablespoons dry sherry
¾	pound mushrooms (3 cups) (shiitake, oyster and white), stems discarded, caps thinly sliced
½	cup whipping cream
2	eggs
¼	cup toasted, finely ground walnuts
2	tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2	teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
⅓	cup fine fresh bread crumbs
2	teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1	teaspoon coarse salt
¼	teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Soak: Pour hot broth over porcini in a bowl. Let soften, 30 minutes. Squeeze mushrooms, letting juice drip into bowl. Rinse, chop and set aside in a large bowl.
Strain: Line a sieve with a coffee filter; set over a small saucepan. Pour mushroom-soaking liquid through; discard grit. Heat to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until liquid is reduced to ¼ cup, 10 minutes. Pour over porcini.
Sizzle: Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic; cook soft, 6 minutes. Add sherry; cook, stirring, 1 minute. Scrape into blender. Heat remaining butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add sliced mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until wilted, 2 minutes. Scrape half the sautéed mushrooms into the blender, and the other half into the porcini mixture.
Blend: Add cream, eggs and walnuts to blender; swirl smooth. Pour into porcini mixture. Stir in parsley, thyme, bread crumbs, lemon juice, salt, pepper.
Bake: Pour mixture into a loaf pan (buttered, lined with parchment and buttered again). Cover with foil. Set in a larger baking pan; slide into a 350F oven. Pour in hot water to rise halfway up sides of loaf pan. Bake until outer edges are set but center remains soft, 45 minutes. Cool. Chill 6 hours. Bring pate to room temperature before unmolding; serve with garlic toast or crackers.
