Artichokes Stuffed

4 servings

4	medium to large artichokes
2	cups of bread crumbs
2	cups grated parmesan cheese
4	cloves garlic - finely chopped
½	cup chopped parsley
½	cup olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
juice of one lemon

Cut top and bottom from the artichokes. Turn each one upside down and mash slightly to open leaves, then turn it back over and, using a melon baller, remove the choke from the center, taking care to remove all of the inedible parts.
Mix the breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, garlic and parsley in a bowl. Fill the center of each artichoke with stuffing, then put a small amount of stuffing down inside each leaf (a spoon works nicely to lever a leaf open, if need be, and to put in the stuffing).
Put about 1 inch of water in a Dutch oven, adding one tablespoon of the olive oil and the juice of one lemon to the water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce to a vigorous simmer. Lightly pour olive oil over the stuffed artichokes and place them in the water. Cover and simmer for one hour. The artichokes are done when a leaf pulls out easily.
