Beet Napoleons

40-50 appetizers

10 to 12 small red and/or yellow beets
12	 ounces goat cheese, at room temperature
1	cup finely chopped fresh chives
1	teaspoon kosher salt
1	teaspoon black pepper

Heat the oven to 400F.
Trim the beet stems approximately 2 inches above each beat and trim off the root. Boil in salted water for 20-25 minutes until the beets are tender. Remove the beets one at a time from the boiling water and run under cold water to cool. Using your fingers, skin each beet completely and trim the ends. Place a piece of parchment paper on a cutting board. Slice the beets ⅛ to ¼ inch thick; set aside to cool and dry completely.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine the goat cheese, chives, salt, and pepper.
To assemble, place 1 beet slice on a platter. Spread ½ teaspoon of the cheese mixture over the beet. Top with another slice; repeat with one more slice of beet and 1 more teaspoon of the cheese mixture. You should have a stack of three slices of beet with some cheese mixture in between each slice. Repeat with the remaining beets and cheese mixture.
