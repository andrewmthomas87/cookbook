The freshest tuna is cooked over a very high heat to seal the outside and create a crisp exterior, while the inside of the fish remains raw. It is then cut into thin slices and marinated in olive oil, lemon juice and balsamic vinegar, with pine nuts and raisins. This recipe combines Japanese and Italian influences. The secret of success lies in the tuna being as fresh as possible, and the pan being as hot as possible.
Slice the tuna fillet in half, and then rub with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining oil in a heavy-based frying pan, or cast-iron griddle. When it is very hot, add the tuna, one piece at a time. Cook over a very high heat for about one minute on each side, including the ends, using two wooden spoons to turn the fish. Make sure it's well browned and verging on crisp on the outside. Remove from the pan and allow cooling, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
To prepare the marinade, in a small bowl mix together the olive oil, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, cloves, bay leaf, pine nuts, raisins, sugar and chili flakes.
When the tuna is chilled and firm, unwrap and, using a very sharp knife, cut into thin slices, about ¼ inch) thick. Lay the tuna slices, overlapping, in a shallow glass or earthenware dish and pour on the marinade. Cover and leave to marinate in the refrigerator for several hours, or overnight if possible.
Take the tuna out of the refrigerator an hour or so before serving, to let it come to room temperature. Serve the tuna slices on a bed of spinach or rocket with the marinade spooned over.
