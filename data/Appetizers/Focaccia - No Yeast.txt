Focaccia - No Yeast

12 servings

3	 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more for greasing pan
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading dough
2(1/2)	 teaspoons baking powder
1	tablespoon chopped fresh herbs, plus more for topping
2	teaspoons garlic powder
1	teaspoon kosher salt

Preheat the oven to 425F. Grease an 8 or 9 inch baking pan generously with olive oil.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, herbs, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
Add the water, milk and 2 tablespoons olive oil and using a spatula, mix until combined.
Flour your work surface then turn out the dough.
Knead the dough for 1 minute, adding more flour as needed if it's too sticky. (The dough should still be tacky and slightly sticky.)
Grease your hands with olive oil then transfer the dough to the greased baking pan. Using your fingers, press the dough into an even layer, then use your fingertips to make indentations across the dough. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of olive oil on top and sprinkle with additional herbs.
Bake the focaccia for 16 to 20 minutes until pale golden. Remove it from the oven then slice and serve.
