24 appetizers

Sauce Ingredients:
½	cup dark brown sugar
½	cup soy sauce, preferably Japanese or reduced sodium
½	cup mirin (sweet rice wine), or 1/2 cup sake with 1/4 cup sugar
¼	cup chopped peeled ginger
1	teaspoon ground coriander

1	bunch cilantro, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
1	egg, lightly beaten
2	tablespoons sesame oil
2	tablespoons soy sauce
Freshly ground black pepper
Vegetable oil

Make sauce: Bring sugar and ½ cup water to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar melts completely. Reduce heat to medium-low and add soy sauce, mirin, ginger, coriander and peppercorns. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Strain through a sieve. (Can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated.)
Make meatballs: mix turkey, scallions, cilantro, egg, sesame oil, soy sauce and several grindings of pepper in a bowl. Roll tablespoons of mixture into balls.
In a skillet over medium-high heat, generously cover bottom of pan with vegetable oil. Working in batches to avoid crowding, place meatballs in pan and cook, turning, until browned all over and cooked inside, about 8 minutes per batch. Arrange on a heated platter, spoon a little sauce over each meatball, and serve with toothpicks. If desired, keep warm in a 200-degree oven until ready to serve.
