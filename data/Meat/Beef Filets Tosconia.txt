Beef Filets Toscania

4 servings

4	eight-ounce filets of beef tenderloin with fat trimmed off
4	strips of bacon
16	smoked oysters
8	ounces button or crimini mushrooms
2	tablespoons olive oil
¼	cup dry sherry
1	 cup Béarnaise sauce

Sauté mushrooms in olive oil for two minutes then add sherry and sauté until soft. Set mushrooms aside. Prepare Béarnaise sauce and set aside. Wrap each beef filet with a strip of bacon, securing with half of a toothpick. The bacon should be wrapped around the outside edge of the filet while it is laying flat. Grill (broil) the filets to an internal temperature of 125F for rare, more for medium-rare. They will continue to cook after removal from the grill, so anticipate the delay to the table. Place each filet on a separate plate, top first with four smoked oysters, second with ¼ of the sautéed mushrooms, finishing off with ¼ cup of the Bernaise sauce. Serve immediately. Use multiple quantities to scale recipe for more servings.
