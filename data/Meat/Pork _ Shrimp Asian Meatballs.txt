Place the green onions, garlic, ginger, and water chestnuts in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until ingredients are finely chopped. Transfer to a large bowl; add pork, and mix.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs; cook, turning often, until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Cook the egg noodles (or pasta) al dente in salted boiling water (5-7 minutes); drain and toss in a large skillet with remaining 2 teaspoons of the sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil. Meanwhile, cook the snow peas for about 3 minutes in the boiling noodle water, remove and add to the noodles.
Serve meatballs over the noodles and sprinkle with the remaining chopped green onions.
