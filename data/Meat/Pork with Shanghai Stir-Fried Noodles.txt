½	teaspoon  plus2 tablespoons soy sauce
1½	teaspoons rice wine
1	teaspoon cornstarch
1	pound fresh Shanghai noodles or Japanese Udon noodles
2	tablespoons peanut oil, plus a splash

Lime, optional

Cut the pork evenly into ¼ inch slices, then into ⅛ inch slivers.
In a small bowl, combine ½ teaspoon light soy sauce, the Shaoxing wine, the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon cold water and mix well. Add pork and marinate until ready to cook.
Bring a large, deep pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for 2 minutes. Turn the cooked noodles into a colander and rinse with cold water. Shake them dry and toss with a splash of oil, stirring thoroughly to prevent sticking.
In a small bowl, combine remaining light soy sauce, the dark soy sauce and the chicken stock and set aside. Heat one tablespoon of the peanut oil in a large, seasoned wok over high heat until oil just begins to smoke. Add the pork, leaving the marinade behind, and stir-fry swiftly to separate. When they are just cooked, remove from wok and set aside.
Clean and re-season the wok, if necessary, then return it to high heat with the remaining oil. Add noodles and soy sauce mixture and stir-fry until piping hot. Add the bokchoy  and continue to stir-fry briefly until wilted. Stir in the pork and season to taste with salt and white pepper. Serve.
