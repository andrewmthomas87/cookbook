Lamb - Oven-Braised with Greens

6 to 8 servings

2	pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 3” cubes
Salt and pepper
2	tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons
1	large onion, thinly sliced
1	rib celery, halved
2	bay leaves
2	cloves garlic, thinly sliced
4	sprigs fresh marjoram
1	small dried chile pepper
1	cup canned drained tomatoes, coarsely chopped
¼	cup basic tomato sauce, recipe follows
¾	cup dry red or white wine
1½	pounds dandelion or escarole, cut into thick ¼-inch chiffonade
2	bunches Italian parsley, chopped to yield ½ cup
¼	cup slivered caciocavallo or pecorino cheese

Preheat the oven to 300F.
Season the meat with salt and pepper. In a heavy skillet or casserole, over high heat, sear the meat in 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, browning on all sides. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.
Lower heat to medium and gently sweat the sliced onion, celery, bay leaves, garlic, marjoram, and chile pepper in 2 tablespoons of the oil until soft and starting to turn golden. Add the tomatoes and tomato sauce to the pan, season, and let reduce for 5 minutes. Deglaze with wine, add in the lamb pieces, raise the heat to medium, and when the liquid comes to a simmer, cover and cook in the oven for 1 hour.
After 1 hour, add the greens to the pot, setting them directly on top of the meat and its juices. Cover and return to the oven for 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven, discard the celery, bay leaves, and chile pepper, and transfer the meat and greens to a serving platter. Top with slivered cheese and serve immediately.
