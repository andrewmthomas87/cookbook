Beef Paprikas

6 servings

4	tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter
1	large green bell pepper; chopped
2	tablespoon all-purpose flour
2½	cup beef stock
2	large onions; chopped
1	pounds mushrooms, sliced
1½	tablespoon paprika, Hungarian sweet
¾	cup sour cream
1¾	pounds beef tenderloin cut into ½ inch slices
Chopped tomatoes (optional)
1	tablespoon tomato paste
3	tablespoon chopped fresh dill
¼	cup dry white wine

Melt half the butter in heavy large deep skillet over medium heat. Add onions and bell pepper and sauté until light golden, about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and sauté until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Mix in flour and paprika and stir 2 minutes. Mix in stock and tomato paste. Bring to boil, stirring constantly. Boil until sauce thickens and paprika flavor mellows, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Mix in sour cream. Remove from heat and add dill. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before adding beef.) Melt half of remaining butter in another heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add beef, season with salt and pepper and cook until just brown on each side. Transfer to plate. Add more butter as needed. When all beef is brown, add to sauce along with any drippings on plate. Add dry white wine to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Boil until syrupy, about 3 minutes. Add to beef. Sprinkle with chopped tomatoes before serving, if desired.
