Meatloaf - Spicy, Garlicky

6-8 servings

5	garlic cloves, minced
3	scallions, white and light green parts, finely chopped
1	medium jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely chopped
1	tablespoon chopped fresh sage
2	teaspoons kosher salt
1	teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1	cup dried bread crumbs
3	tablespoons chicken stock, heavy cream or milk
1	pound ground pork
1	pound ground beef
1	tablespoon tomato paste
½	tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 	tablespoons pine nuts (optional)

Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, garlic, scallions, jalapeño, sage, salt and black pepper.
In a separate bowl, stir together bread crumbs and stock, cream or milk. Let stand five minutes.
Add pork, beef and soaked bread crumbs to egg mixture. Knead ingredients together until just combined. Press mixture evenly into an 8- or 9-inch loaf pan. Bake for 55 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk together the tomato paste and olive oil. After meatloaf has finished baking, brush top with glaze; sprinkle with pine nuts, if using. Bake 15 minutes more (glaze will be thick and a meat thermometer should read 160 degrees). Let meatloaf rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
