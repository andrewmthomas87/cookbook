Lamb Cardamom Picatta Kebab

4 servings

2¼	pound lamb
2½	ounces raw papaya
3	tablespoons finely minced ginger
3	tablespoons finely minced garlic
½	teaspoon black pepper
Salt
Butter for basting
Marinade Ingredients:
½	cup yoghurt
2	teaspoons chili powder
2	teaspoons green cardamom powder
4	teaspoons lemon juice
4	teaspoons Garam Masala*

Clean, debone, and cut the lamb into 1½-inch chunks and flatten to ⅛-inch thick picatta. Peel and mash the papaya, add the ginger, garlic, salt, and pepper. Rub the picatta with this mixture and set aside for 1½ hours.
Hang the yoghurt in muslin for 4 hours to remove the whey. Transfer to a large bowl, add the remaining ingredients, whisk, and rub the picatta with this mixture and set aside for 1 more hour.
Preheat the oven to 350F. Skewer the picatta by piercing at both ends and arrange ends 1 inch apart. Place on a rack in a large pan to catch the drippings and bake for 10 minutes.
*Garam Masala can be made by grinding cumin seeds, coriander seeds, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, black peppercorns and nutmeg in a food processor.
