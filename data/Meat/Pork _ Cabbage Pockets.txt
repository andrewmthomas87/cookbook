Pork & Cabbage Pockets

4 servings

2	pounds cavolo nero (black cabbage)
4	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus 4 tablespoons
2	Spanish onions sliced thin
2	garlic cloves, thinly sliced
¼	bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped to yield ⅛ cup
1	teaspoon fennel seeds
Pinch chili flakes
1	pound pork loin, cut into 4 pieces, pounded to form large flat pieces
Salt and pepper
1	cup dry white wine
Chopped parsley, for garnish

Bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.
Cut the cabbage into 2-inch ribbons. Add the cabbage to the boiling water and cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain well and set aside to cool.
In a 12 to 14-inch sauté pan, heat the olive oil over a medium-high flame until hot but not smoking. Add the onions and garlic and cook until soft about 5 minutes. Add parsley, fennel seeds, cooked cabbage and chili flakes, and then toss to mix and remove from heat.
Lay the pork pieces out flat on a board and season well with salt. Divide the cabbage mixture over the 4 pieces and fold the pieces across to create a pocket, close and secure with toothpicks.
Heat 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in another 12 to 14-inch sauté pan over medium heat. Place the pork pockets in the pan and cook until golden brown on both sides. Add the wine, lower the heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes. Remove the pork to a plate, swirl the remaining olive oil into the pan, add chopped parsley to the liquid, pour over the pockets and serve.
