In a bowl combine 6 tablespoons of the oil, fennel seeds, tarragon, lime peel, pepper, and salt. Stir well. Coat the tenderloin with seed mixture. Place meat on a non-reactive tray; cover loosely with foil. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.

In a bowl, toss together onions and 1 tablespoon of the remaining olive oil. Place onions on half of the roasting pan alongside meat. Roast, uncovered for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, toss together fennel and remaining oil. Stir onions and add fennel to other half of roasting pan alongside meat.
