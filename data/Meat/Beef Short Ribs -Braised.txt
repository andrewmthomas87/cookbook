Beef Short Ribs - Braised

4-6 servings

¼	cup canola oil
4	pounds beef short ribs
4	leeks, sliced ½ inch thick
4	large carrots, peeled, coarsely chopped
1	large onion, chopped
1	large leek (white and pale green part only) chopped
1	whole head garlic, halved crosswise
1	tablespoon ground coriander
1	tablespoon ground cardamom
2	tablespoons all purpose flour
1	bottle (750 ml) dry red fruity wine (such as Zinfandel)
2	cups chicken broth

Preheat oven to 325F. Heat canola oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over high heat. Sprinkle short ribs with salt and pepper. Working in batches, add ribs to pot and cook until brown on all sides, about 6 minutes per batch. (This is the messy part.)
Transfer ribs to large bowl. Add carrots, onion, leek, and garlic to pot. Cook until vegetables are brown, stirring often, about 12 minutes.
Add coriander and cardamom, then flour; stir to coat vegetables. Add wine and bring sauce to boil. Return ribs and any accumulated juices from bowl to pot. Add chicken broth. Bring to boil, cover and transfer pot to oven. Braise until ribs are tender, about two hours.
