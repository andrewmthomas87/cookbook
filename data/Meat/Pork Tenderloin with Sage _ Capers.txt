Pork Tenderloin with Sage & Capers

4 servings

¼	cup extra virgin olive oil
¾	ounce unsalted butter
1	onion, finely chopped
½	cup fresh white breadcrumbs
2	teaspoons chopped fresh sage
1	tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
2	teaspoons lemon zest
2½	tablespoons capers, rinsed & drained
1	egg
2	one pound + pork tenderloins
8	large thin slices of prosciutto
¼	cup all purpose flour
½	cup dry vermouth
1¼	cups chicken broth
8	whole sage leaves for garnish

Brine the pork tenderloins for 30 minutes in 2 quarts of water with ½ cup salt and ¼ cup sugar.
Preheat the oven to 325F. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and the butter in an iron skillet, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until lightly golden.
Place the breadcrumbs, chopped sage, parsley, lemon zest, ½ tablespoon of the capers, and the cooked onion in a bowl. Add the egg and season well with salt. Reserve the iron skillet for later.
Split each pork tenderloin in half lengthwise and open out. Spread the stuffing down the length of one tenderloin and cover with the other, head to tail. Wrap the two tenderloins and the stuffing with the prosciutto to make a neat parcel. Tie with string at intervals.
Place the pork in the iron skillet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Bake for 1 hour. Test with an instant read thermometer and cook until the internal temperature reaches 150F. Remove the tenderloin package from the pan and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Let rest for 10 minutes while finishing the sauce.
Place the skillet on the stovetop, add the flour and stir in well. Add the vermouth and allow to bubble for 1 minute. Add the chicken broth and stir while cooking to remove all the lumps. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add the remaining capers to the sauce.
Heat the remaining olive oil in a small skillet and sauté the whole sage leaves until crisp. Drain on paper towels.
Slice the pork into ½ inch slices, spoon a little sauce over, and serve each portion with fried sage leaves on top.
