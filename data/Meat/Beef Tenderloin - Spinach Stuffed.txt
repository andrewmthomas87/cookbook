Beef Tenderloin - Spinach Stuffed

6 servings

3½	pound beef tenderloin
Salt and pepper
1	cup cooked spinach, squeezed and chopped
½	cup julienne roasted red peppers or pimentos
6	garlic cloves, sliced
½	cup grated Parmesan cheese
2	tablespoons oil

Preheat oven to 400F. Slice tenderloin open down its entire length. Season generously inside and out. Spread spinach to cover inside surface. Top with roasted peppers and garlic. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Reform tenderloin and tie every 3 inches with butchers twine, to hold in the filling. In a large sauté pan heat oil and sear meat on all sides. Roast on a rack in a roasting pan for 15 to 20 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 120F to 125F for rare (for medium-rare, roast until temperature registers 135F to 140F). Remove, cut into 1-inch thick filets, or cool completely and wrap air tight for a picnic.
