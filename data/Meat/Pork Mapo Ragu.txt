Pork Mapo Ragu

4-6 servings

3	tablespoons canola
2	large onions, peeled and sliced
Pinch of kosher salt, or to taste
1	pound ground pork
4	cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
1	inch fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
3	tablespoons miso
1	tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
1	tablespoon brown sugar
1	teaspoons red peppercorn flakes
1	bunch greens, roughly chopped rice noodles, or pasta, or steamed rice
4	scallions, thinly sliced, for garnish

Heat the oil in a wok set over medium-high heat. When it shimmers, add the onions and the pinch of salt. Cook stirring occasionally, until the onions have released their moisture and are starting to brown, approximately 10 minutes. Then turn the heat down to low, and continue to cook, stirring every few minutes, until they have turned golden brown and sweet, an additional 20 minutes or so
Tip the onions into a bowl, and return the wok to high heat over the stove. Add remainingtablespoon of oil, then the pork, and cook, breaking the meat up with a spoon, until it is just cooked, but not yet browning, approximately 10 minutes. Add the cooked meat to the reserved onions.
Return wok to stove over medium heat and cook the garlic and ginger in fat remaining from pork (add an extra splash of oil if necessary). When the garlic and ginger soften, add gochujang, soy sauce, brown sugar and, if using, the Sichuan peppercorns. Add 1/2 cup to 1 cup of water, enough to loosen the mixture and make a sauce, then return pork and onions to the wok and stir a started to soften, approximately 5 minutes.
If using rice cakes, place them in the boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes to soften, then drain and add to the sauce. (If not, serve the rag√π with steamed rice, rice noodles or pasta.) Garnish with the sliced scallions.
