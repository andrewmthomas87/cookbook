Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic, red and green bell peppers and sauté until onions are translucent, about 8 minutes. Add beef and sauté until brown, about 5 minutes. Add chili powder and cumin and stir 2 minutes. Mix in the diced tomatoes, chicken broth, beer, and tomato paste. Simmer until thickened to desired consistency, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Mix in the kidney beans and simmer 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with sour cream, cheddar cheese, green onions, and cilantro on the side. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Refrigerate until cold, then cover. Re-warm over low heat before serving.)
