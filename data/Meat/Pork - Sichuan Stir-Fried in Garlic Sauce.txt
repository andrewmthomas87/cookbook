Cut pork into ½ x 2 inch strips. Tenderize by soaking in ½ cup of water with the teaspoon of baking soda for 15 minutes. Whisk all marinade ingredients together and set aside. Mince the white parts of the scallions and add them to the minced garlic with the chili garlic sauce and set aside.
Drain then rinse and dry the pork strips with paper towels, then add 2 teaspoons of rice wine and two teaspoons of cornstarch and mix thoroughly to coat the pork.
Heat the 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a wok until just before it smokes. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for 2 to 4 minutes until slightly wilted. Add the celery and stir-fry for another 2 to 4 minutes until it gets slightly tender. Set the vegetables aside in a bowl and add another three tablespoons of vegetable oil to the wok. Add the chili garlic paste and heat. Remove a tablespoon of the oil and reserve. Add the pork and stir-fry 3 to 5 minutes until it is crispy brown and cooked through. Whisk the sauce well and add it to the wok. Simmer until the sauce thickens, then stir in the vegetables and heat thoroughly. Garnish with the reserved scallion greens, add the reserved spicy oil and serve over rice.
