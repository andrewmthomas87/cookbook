Veal Chops & Radicchio with Lemon Caper Sauce

2 servings

2	eight-nine ounce veal cutlets, each about ¾-inch thick
4	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1½	tablespoons white balsamic vinegar
1½	tablespoons drained capers
1½	tablespoons chopped fresh Italian Parsley
1¼	teaspoons finely grated lemon peel
1	small garlic clove, minced
¼	to ½ cup dry white wine
6	radicchio leaves

Whisk 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and the next 5 ingredients in a small bowl to blend. Season sauce to taste with salt and paper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Prepare barbeque (medium-high heat) or heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Brush veal chops with remaining 1 tablespoon of the olive oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place veal chops on the grill or in the skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium. Transfer to platter. Brush radicchio lightly with some of the sauce. Place the radicchio leaves on the grill or in the skillet and cook just until slightly wilted but not brown, pressing lightly to flatten, about 45 seconds to 1 minute per side.
Divide radicchio and veal chops between plates, spoon sauce over and serve.
