Season lamb pieces with salt and pepper. In a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the lamb pieces, 5 to 6 at a time, and brown on all sides. Remove and repeat for all the lamb. When the lamb is cooked, add the onions and smoked pancetta, and cook until the onion is softened and starting to brown, about 9 to 11 minutes. Add the rosemary, thyme, caraway and fennel and stir to blend. Add the wine, tomato paste, chicken stock and tomato sauce and bring to a boil. Return the lamb and juices and bring to boil.
Lower the heat, cover and simmer 1 hour, or until the meat is tender. Remove the cover, check the seasoning and serve with soft polenta.
