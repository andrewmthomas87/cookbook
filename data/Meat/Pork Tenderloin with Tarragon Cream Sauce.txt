4 servings

1	one pound pork tenderloin in two parts
1	teaspoon vegetable oil
1	large garlic clove, minced
2	tablespoons minced shallot
½	cup dry white wine
1	cup whipping cream
½	cup sour cream
1	tablespoon Dijon mustard

Tarragon cream sauce: Sauté the shallot and garlic in the vegetable oil until soft but not browned. Add the white wine and reduce by half; lower the heat to simmer and add the whipping cream, sour cream, Dijon mustard and salt & pepper and simmer until warm. Set aside and keep warm.
Pork Tenderloin: Carefully remove the tendons from the pork tenderloins. Brine the pork tenderloins for 30 minutes in 2 quarts of water with ½ cup salt and ¼ cup sugar. Dry with paper towels, then slightly flatten and score the flat sides longways with a fork. Join the two pork tenderloins head to tail with the scored sides together and tie with meat twine. Rub gently with olive oil, and then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sauté in an iron skillet for about 3 minutes on each side, then place in a preheated 350F oven for 15-20 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 140F with an instant read thermometer.
Remove from oven, cover and let set for 5 minutes while you make the tarragon cream sauce.
Remove the meat wine and slice ½ to ¾ inch thick on the diagonal. Arrange on serving platter and nap with the tarragon cream sauce. Serve with roast potatoes & green vegetable.
