Lamb Shanks - Rosemary Braised with Mascarpone Polenta

4 servings

1	cup all purpose flour
1	tablespoon Essence, recipe follows
4	large lamb shanks
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2	tablespoons olive oil
2	tablespoons unsalted butter
1½	cups chopped yellow onions
¾	cup chopped carrots
¾	cup chopped celery
2	tablespoons minced garlic
2	cups dry red wine
1	cup peeled, seeded and chopped tomatoes
2	bay leaves
2	tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves
1	tablespoon minced fresh rosemary leaves
2	sprigs fresh thyme
2	cups chicken broth
2	cups beef broth

In a shallow dish, combine the flour and Essence. Season the lamb liberally with salt and pepper, then dredge the lamb shanks in the seasoned flour, shaking to remove any excess. In a large Dutch oven, heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat until hot. Add the lamb shanks, in batches if necessary to prevent overcrowding, and cook until well-browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the shanks from the pan and set aside. Add the onions, carrots, and celery to the pan, and cook, stirring, until soft and caramelized around the edges, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the wine and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring to deglaze the pan. Cook until reduced by half. Add the tomatoes and bay leaves and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the rosemary, thyme, chicken broth, beef broth, and reserved shanks and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, season with salt and pepper, cover tightly, and cook, turning the meat occasionally, until the meat is tender and falling from the bone.
