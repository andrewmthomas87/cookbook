4 servings

4	veal shanks, about 1 pound each
½	cup all-purpose flour
4	tablespoons olive oil
1	large onion, chopped
1	large carrot, peeled and chopped
1	stalk celery, chopped
½	green pepper, chopped
½	red pepper, chopped
4	large cloves garlic, finely chopped
½	cup dry white wine
Juice of ½ lemon
1	can (14½ ounces) low-salt chicken broth
1	can (14½ ounces) crushed tomatoes, with juices
1	bay leaf
½	teaspoon dried thyme
1	teaspoon dried marjoram
1½	tablespoons parsley
Sprigs of rosemary for garnish
Salt and pepper to taste
Gremolata
2	tablespoons chopped parsley
2	tablespoons minced garlic
1	tablespoon grated lemon zest

Preheat oven to 350F. Season the shanks with salt and pepper. Dust lightly with the flour. Heat an ovenproof sauté large enough to hold the shanks in one layer over high heat. Add the olive oil and heat. Add the shanks and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and reduce heat to medium-high. Place the onions, carrots, celery and peppers in the pan. Sauté until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté one more minute. Pour in the wine and broth. Return heat to high and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the lemon juice, tomatoes, bay leaf, thyme, marjoram, the 1½ tablespoons of parsley and additional salt and pepper. Cook, uncovered, until reduced by about one-third. (There should be enough liquid to come about half way up the sides of the shanks.) Return the shanks, and any accumulated juices, to the pan. Cover tightly and place in oven. Cook until the meat is very tender and starting to fall off the bones, 1½ to 2 hours. Remove the shanks from the pan. Cook the sauce over high heat until reduced as desired. Mix together the Gremolata ingredients; add to the sauce and stir well to combine. Serve the shanks, spooning some sauce over each and placing a sprig of rosemary alongside the bone.
