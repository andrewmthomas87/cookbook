Pork Pot Roast with Fennel Sausage & Spinach

N/A

1	trimmed boneless pork roast, about 2 1/2 to 3 pounds
½	teaspoon each: salt, freshly ground pepper
2	tablespoons olive oil
10	to 12 ounces uncooked Italian sausage, removed from the casing
1 large red onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1	twenty-eight ounce can crushed tomatoes with basil
½	cup red wine
1	large green bell pepper, cored, cut into ½ inch pieces
1	cup thickly sliced cremini mushrooms
½	teaspoon oregano
¼	teaspoon fennel seed
1	twelve ounces fresh spinach leaves, ends trimmed, well rinsed, patted dry
Cooked pasta for serving
Flat-leaf parsley sprigs

Pat pork dry. Season on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Brown pork in the oil until well browned on both sides, 10-12 minutes total. Transfer meat to the slow cooker.
Add sausage and onion to skillet. Cook, breaking up sausage with a spoon, until browned, about 10 minutes. Drain off excess fat. Stir in tomatoes, wine, green bell pepper, mushrooms, oregano and fennel. Pour over pork in slow cooker. Cook on low until pork is fork-tender, about 8 hours. (You can use the high setting for 4 hours, but the pork won't be quite as tender). Skim off solidified fat; reheat gently in a large saucepan on low heat.)
Carefully remove roast to a serving platter; tent with foil. Skim off fat from pan juices. Taste and season with salt, if necessary. Stir spinach into hot pan juices to wilt it slightly. Serve roast thinly sliced over the pasta. Top pork slices and pasta with tomato and spinach mixture. Garnish with parsley sprigs.
