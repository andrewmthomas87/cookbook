Beef - Pan-Seared Steaks

4 servings

4	boneless strip or filet mignon steaks
1½ to 1¾ inches thick, (1 pound ea.)
1	tablespoon vegetable oil
Kosher salt
ground black pepper
Red wine mushroom pan sauce
1	tablespoon vegetable oil
8	ounces button mushrooms, trimmed and sliced thin (3 cups)
1	shallot, minced (1½ tablespoons)
1	cup dry red wine
½	cup chicken broth
1	tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1	teaspoon Dijon mustard
2	tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
1	teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
Salt and ground black pepper

Adjust oven rack to middle position and pre-heat to 275F. Pat steaks dry with paper towels. Cut each steak in half vertically to create four 8 ounce steaks. Season steaks liberally with salt and pepper, using hands, gently shape into uniform thickness. Place steaks on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, then transfer baking sheet to oven. Cook until instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into center of steaks registers 90-95F for rare to medium-rare, 20-25 minutes.
Heat oil in a 12 inch heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until smoking. Place steaks in the skillet and sear until well browned and crusty on all sides, 1½ to 2 minutes. (Hold vertically with tongs to do sides).
Return steaks to the wire rack and let rest, loosely tented with foil for about 5 minutes.
Sauce: Pour fat from skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown and liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to soften, about 1 minute. Increase heat to high, add red wine and broth, scraping bottom of skillet with a wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Add vinegar, mustard, and any juices from roasting steaks, cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and thyme; season with salt and pepper to taste.
Spoon sauce over steaks and serve immediately.
