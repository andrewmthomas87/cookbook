Meatloaf with Caramelized Cabbage

4 servings

FOR THE MEATLOAF:
2	tablespoons + 1 teaspoon unsalted butter
1	head green cabbage, cored & shredded
3	tablespoons molasses
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
¾	pound ground beef
¾	pound ground pork
1	small yellow onion, peeled and chopped
1	cup heavy cream
4	tablespoons breadcrumbs
⅓	cup chicken, beef or vegetable stock
FOR THE SAUCE:
⅓	cup lingonberry preserves
1	tablespoon red-wine vinegar
1	tablespoon unsalted butter
1	teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Heat oven to 350F. Put a large pan over medium-high heat, and add the butter. When it starts to foam, add the cabbage and molasses, lower the heat to medium and sprinkle with salt. Cook slowly, stirring often until all the liquid has evaporated and the cabbage is caramelized, approximately 20-25 minutes.
While the cabbage is cooking, lightly mix the meats in a large bowl, and then add the onion, cream and breadcrumbs, and mix again to combine.
When the cabbage is done, add about a third of it to the meat mixture, and mix to combine. Use the remaining butter to grease an 8-inch-square baking pan, and transfer the meat mixture to it, spreading it out to cover the whole surface evenly. Spread remaining cabbage over the meat, pour the stock or water over the top and place in the oven, on a sheet tray, to cook for approximately 40 to 45 minutes, or until the cabbage is very, very caramelized, almost dry and crunchy at the edges. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes or so before serving.
While the meat and cabbage cooks, make the sauce. Heat lingonberry preserves, vinegar and butter in a small pot set over medium heat, and then add Worcestershire sauce to taste. Serve alongside the kalpudding.
