Beef Tenderloin - Herb Wrapped with Creole Mustard

8 to 10 servings

3 tablespoons vegetable oil
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1	beef tenderloin, trimmed and tied (about 3½ to 4 pounds)
½	cup Creole mustard, or other spicy whole-grained mustard
8	cloves garlic, finely minced or pressed
1	bunch fresh rosemary, finely chopped
1	bunch fresh thyme, finely chopped

Preheat the oven to 425F.
In a large skillet, heat oil over high heat until almost smoking. Season beef on all sides generously with salt and pepper and transfer meat to the skillet. Cook beef until well-browned on all sides, turning with tongs when necessary.
Transfer the beef to a cutting board or platter and, using a rubber spatula or spoon, rub all over with Creole mustard and garlic. Cover meat with chopped herbs, using your hands to evenly pat herbs into the mustard coating. Place prepared meat in a shallow roasting pan and cook about 20 to 25 minutes, or until meat registers 125F on an instant read thermometer for medium-rare. Remove meat from the oven and let it stand at least 10 minutes before slicing to serve.
Note: Meat may also be served at room temperature, and in this case should not be sliced until just before serving.
