Pork Chops Smoked with Caramelized Fennel & Onions

4 servings

2 tablespoons olive oil
1½	large sweet or white onions, cut in half, cut into thin wedges
½	small head cabbage, chopped
1	bulb fresh fennel, trimmed, halved, thinly sliced
½	teaspoon each: salt, sugar
½	cup low-sodium chicken or beef broth
2	cloves garlic, finely chopped
4	smoked, fully cooked pork loin chops, about 8 ounces each
2	tablespoons whipping cream
2	teaspoons whole grain Dijon mustard
½	cup chicken broth, optional
Chopped fennel fronds for garnish

Heat oil in a large skillet until hot. Add onions. Cook, stirring, over medium-high heat until golden, about 4 minutes. Stir in cabbage, fennel, salt and sugar. Cook, stirring, until richly golden and tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir in broth and garlic. Scrape up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Heat to a boil. Nestle pork chops into the mixture. Cover; simmer over low heat until chops are heated through, about 10 minutes.
Arrange chops on a serving platter. Cover; put into a low oven to keep warm. Increase the heat under the skillet so the pan juices boil. Add cream, mustard and 1/2 cup chicken broth, if needed. Boil until the pan juices lightly coat a spoon. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt. Spoon mixture over pork chops. Sprinkle with chopped fennel.
