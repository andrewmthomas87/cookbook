Dust the meat with the flour. Heat the olive oil over high heat in a Dutch oven and add the meat to sear on all sides. Season the meat with salt and pepper; moisten with the lemon juice and ½ cup of stock. Cover and simmer 30 minutes. Add the pitted olives, half the oregano, the chili flakes and the remaining stock.
