Pork Chops in Lemon-Caper Sauce

4 serving

4	 bone-in pork chops (about 8 ounces each)
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
½	teaspoon dried thyme leaves
2	tablespoons olive oil
4	tablespoons unsalted butter
1	small shallot, minced (about 1 tablespoon)
2	garlic cloves, minced (about 1 teaspoon)
2	teaspoons all-purpose flour
1	cup dry white wine
1½	cups chicken stock, homemade or low-sodium, if store-bought
2	tablespoons drained capers
2	tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus more for garnish
1	teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons juice

Dry the chops with paper towels, and season aggressively with salt, pepper and the thyme. Swirl the olive oil into a large skillet, and heat over medium until the oil begins to shimmer. Add chops, and cook until well browned on each side and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate, and cover to keep warm.
Drain the fat from the skillet, then melt 2 tablespoons of butter in it over medium heat until sizzling. Add the shallot and garlic, and sauté until the aromatics soften, reducing the heat if necessary, about 1 minute. Sprinkle in the flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Whisk in the wine and chicken stock, raise heat to high and bring the liquid to a boil, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered, until the liquid is reduced by half, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir in the capers, parsley, lemon zest and juice and hot sauce to taste (if you’re using it), and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter until it’s melted and the sauce looks smooth. Nestle the pork chops into the sauce, and allow them to warm up for a couple of minutes, then serve, pouring sauce over each pork chop to taste. Garnish with more fresh parsley.
Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the reserved onion tops, and serve.
