Ham with Clementine Pepper Glaze

12 servings

1	smoked ham (6-8 pounds)
Glaze
1½	cups (tightly packed) light brown sugar
2	Clementine’s, stemmed if necessary, quartered, skin left on
2	fresh green Serrano chilies or 1 jalapeño chili, stemmed, seeded and coarsely chopped
2	tablespoons white wine vinegar
1	tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon crushed red peppercorns or peppercorn blend
1	tablespoon Dijon mustard
½	teaspoon ground cinnamon, preferably freshly ground

Combine all glaze ingredients in a food processor and pulse until chilies are reduced to tiny green flecks. Transfer to a jar with a tight-fitting lid and store in refrigerator until needed. Making glaze a day in advance allows flavors to bloom and thickens glaze, which makes it easier to apply.
Place rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 325F. Trim tough rind from ham, leaving as much fat as possible. Place ham flat-side down and score the rounded side all over with diagonal cuts about 1½ inches apart and ¼-inch deep, forming a diamond pattern. In center of each diamond insert a single clove.
Place ham in a roasting pan and bake until a meat thermometer inserted into thickest part reads 135F, about 15 minutes a pound. One hour before ham is done, remove it from oven and brush all over with glaze.
Return ham to oven and continue to bake, glazing ham once or twice more until ham is done. Remove ham from oven, tent with foil and let rest 10 minutes before carving.
