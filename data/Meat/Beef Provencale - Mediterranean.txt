In a bowl, combine the cubed beef with 1 tablespoon of the oil, the onions, 1 cup of wine, and half of the herbs. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator overnight
Drain the beef, reserving the marinade. Heat the remaining oil in a large heavy based saucepan and brown the beef and onion in batches. Remove from the pan.
Add the bacon to the saucepan and cook for 3-5 minutes, until crisp. Return the beef to the pan with the remaining wine and cook, scraping the residue from the bottom of the pan, for 2 minutes, or until the wine has slightly reduced. Add the tomatoes and the stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and add the remaining herbs. Season with salt and pepper, cover and simmer for 1½ hours.
Add the carrots, mushrooms and olives to the saucepan and cook, uncovered, for another 30 minutes or until the meat and the carrots are tender. Before serving, check the seasoning and adjust if necessary.
