Beef - Slow-Cooked with Juniper Berries

4-6 servings

2	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1Â½	cups yellow onion, thinly sliced crosswise
2	pounds beef (chuck steak) cut into 2 or 3 pieces
1	teaspoon juniper berries
2	tablespoons red wine vinegar
Salt & black pepper

Put the olive oil and onion in a heavy braising pot and place the meat on top. Lightly crush the juniper berries by wrapping them in a paper towel and lightly mashing them with a meat pounder, then add them to the pot. Add the vinegar and season with the salt and pepper. Wrap the lid with a wet cloth towel or a triple layer of wet paper towels and cover the pot tightly. Turn the heat under the pot to medium-low.
When you hear the contents of the pot bubbling, remove the lid and adjust the heat so that the meat cooks at a very gentle simmer. replace the lid and simmer until the meat is extremely tender when prodded with a fork, about 2 hours, checking after 1 hour. If all the liquid evaporates before the meat is tender, add a little water. When the meat is done, the sauce should be thick enough to cling to a spoon. If it is too thin, remove the meat and raise the heat until it is reduced.
Slice the meat, return it to the pot to coat with the sauce, and serve.
(This dish may be prepared up to 3 days ahead and reheated over gently heat with 2 tablespoons of water.)
