Veal Chops Smothered with Artichoke, Shallot, and Bacon Ragout

4 servings

½	pound of bacon, trimmed and cut into ¼-inch dice
16	whole shallots, peeled
1	nine ounce package frozen artichoke hearts, thawed and drained
4	ten ounce veal loin or rib chops, patted dry & sprinkled with freshly ground black pepper (veal chops should be 1¼ to 1½-inches thick)
1	cup veal or chicken stock
½	cup whipping (heavy) cream

Fry bacon in a large heavy skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon using slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Pour off bacon drippings and reserve. Set skillet aside.
Heat all but two tablespoons of the bacon drippings in another medium skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until lightly golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add artichoke hearts and continue cooking to blend flavors, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons of bacon drippings in the reserved large skillet until very hot. Add veal chops, reduce heat to medium and cook until well browned about 5 minutes. Turn chops over and season with pepper. Cook until well browned, but still pink and juicy on the inside, about 5 more minutes. Transfer veal to a baking pan, tent with aluminum foil and put in oven to keep warm.
Pour off the fat from the large skillet and return it to high heat. Stir in the stock and cream, scraping up any browned bits and boil until reduced to ¾ cup, about 5 minutes. Add artichoke mixture and the bacon and heat through. Arrange veal chops on plates, spoon the ragout mixture over and serve hot.
