Pork Loin – Milk Braised

4 servings

1	two and a half pound boneless pork loin roast
2	ounces salt pork, diced
½	cup water
1	teaspoon minced fresh sage
¼	teaspoon baking soda
½	teaspoon black pepper
3 cups whole milk
5	cloves garlic, whole
½	cup dry white wine
2	teaspoons minced parsley
1	teaspoon Dijon mustard

Brine the pork loin in the refrigerator for 2 hours in two quarts of water, ¼ cup salt and ¼ cup sugar.
Place the diced salt pork and ½ cup of water in a Dutch oven and simmer for 5-6 minutes until the liquid has disappeared and all the fat is rendered. Sizzle the salt pork for an additional 2-3 minutes until slightly brown, and then remove with a slotted spoon. Add the pork loin to the Dutch oven, raise the heat to medium high and brown on all sides, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 275F.
Add three cups of whole milk to the pot, and then add the garlic cloves, the minced fresh sage and the baking soda. Scrape up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, and cook for 14-16 minutes stirring frequently until it begins to brown a bit. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook 2-3 minutes more until the sauce begins to thicken to the consistency of thin pancake batter. Return the pork loin to the pot, add any accumulated juices, cover and put into a 275F oven for 40-50 minutes, flipping it halfway through to ensure even cooking. When the internal temperature reaches 140F remove the pork loin from the sauce, cover with aluminum foil, and rest for 20 minutes. At the end drain any additional juices to the sauce.
Add the wine to the sauce and simmer for 2-3 minutes, whisking to incorporate it fully. Add the parsley and the Dijon mustard, whisk and taste for seasoning.
Slice the pork and serve with the milk sauce.
