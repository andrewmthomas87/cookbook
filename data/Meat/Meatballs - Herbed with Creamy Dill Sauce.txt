6 servings

Meatball Ingredients:
4	slices homestyle white bread, torn into small pieces
½	cup milk or half-and-half
1	large egg, lightly beaten
4	green onions, trimmed, thinly sliced)
2	tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill
1	teaspoon salt
½	teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
¼	teaspoon freshly ground allspice
1	pound ground beef
1	pound ground pork
Canola oil for cooking
Sauce Ingredients:
1	tablespoon soft butter
2	tablespoons flour
2	cups chicken broth
2	tablespoons whipping cream
2	tablespoons chopped fresh dill
Salt

Mix bread and milk in bottom of large bowl. Let stand until bread has absorbed all of the liquid, about 5 minutes. Stir in the egg, chives, dill, salt, pepper and allspice. Add the meats. Use clean hands to mix lightly until combined. (Fry a small nugget of the mixture in a small nonstick skillet until cooked through; taste and then adjust seasonings in the main mixture accordingly.)
Shape mixture into 1½ inch diameter meatballs; place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.
Heat oven to 200F. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Film the pan lightly with oil. Add the meatballs in a single, uncrowded layer (work in batches, if necessary). Cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides and nearly firm when pressed, 8-10 minutes. Remove the meatballs as they are done to a serving dish; keep warm in the oven until all are cooked.
For the sauce, mix the butter and flour in a small dish. Tip off all but 1 tablespoon fat from the meatball skillet. Stir in the flour mixture; cook over medium heat, 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the broth. Cook, stirring constantly, until smooth and thickened, 3-4 minutes. Stir in cream and 1 tablespoon dill. Season to taste with salt. Spoon the sauce over the meatballs. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon dill. Serve.
