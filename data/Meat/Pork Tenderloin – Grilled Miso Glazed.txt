Lay tenderloins on a cutting board, flat side up. Holding thick end of 1 tenderloin with paper towels and using a dinner fork, scrape flat side lengthwise from end to end 5 times until surface is completely covered with shallow grooves. Repeat with second tenderloin. Brine the pork tenderloins for 1 hour in ¼ cup of salt in 2 quarts of water. Remove and dry with paper towels. Lay 1 tenderloin on the cutting board, scraped side up, then lay the second tenderloin on top thick end to the thin end. Tie tenderloins together with twine, then brush roast with vegetable oil and season with pepper. Brush tenderloins with glaze and grill or broil 4 to 6 minutes, then repeat 2 or three times until internal temperature reaches 140F.
