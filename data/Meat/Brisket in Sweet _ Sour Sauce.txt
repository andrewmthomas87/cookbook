Brisket in Sweet & Sour Sauce

12 servings

For the Pork:
1	first-cut brisket, 6 to 7 pounds, rinsed and patted thoroughly dry
1	medium onion, peeled and quartered
1 	two-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled, cut into chunks
6	large cloves garlic
1  cup ketchup
½	cup dry red wine
¼	cup cider vinegar
¼	cup soy sauce
¼	cup honey
¼ 	cup Dijon mustard
1	tablespoon coarsely ground pepper, or to taste
¼	teaspoon ground cloves
1½	cups Coca-Cola or ginger ale
½ 	cup olive oil

Let meat stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. Heat oven to 325 degrees.
Place everything but the soda, olive oil and brisket into a food processor, and process with steel blade until smooth. Pour the mixture into a large bowl and whisk in soda and olive oil.
Place brisket, fat side up, into a heavy baking pan just large enough to hold it, and pour sauce over it. Cover tightly and bake for 3 hours. Turn brisket over, cover pan, and bake 2 to 3 hours more or until fork-tender. Cool, cover brisket and refrigerate overnight in cooking pan.
The next day, transfer brisket to a cutting board, cut off fat and slice with a sharp knife against grain, to desired thickness. Set meat aside. Remove any congealed fat from sauce and bring to a boil on top of stove.
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Taste sauce to see if it needs reducing. If so, boil it down for a few minutes or as needed. Return meat to sauce and warm in oven for 20 minutes. Serve warm.
