6 servings

6	cooked potatoes, peeled, sliced
½	pound cooked corned beef, sliced
½	cup sour cream
¼	cup prepared horseradish

Place one layer of sliced potatoes in a buttered casserole. Spread half of the leeks, bacon, sour cream, horseradish and cheese on the potatoes. Top with sliced corned beef, the remaining leeks, sour cream and horseradish. Top with a final layer of potatoes; sprinkle with remaining cheese.
