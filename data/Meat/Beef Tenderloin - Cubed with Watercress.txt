Beef Tenderloin – Cubed with Watercress

4 servings

2	pound piece of beef tenderloin, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes
2	tablespoons chopped garlic
2	tablespoons chopped fresh ginger root
2	tablespoons sugar
Juice of one lime
Salt & pepper
5	tablespoons corn oil or canola
¼	cup rice-wine vinegar
¼	cup rice or white wine
3	tablespoons soy sauce
1	tablespoon fish sauce
1	medium red onion, peeled and slice thin
3	scallions, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths, including green parts
2	tablespoons butter
2	bunches fresh watercress, washed and spun dry

Marinate beef with garlic, ginger, 1 tablespoon of the sugar, the lime juice, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, and 1 tablespoon of the oil for about 2 hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Meanwhile, combine the rice-wine vinegar, the other tablespoon of the sugar, wine, soy sauce and the fish sauce.
Divide the meat into 2 portions. Set a wok or a large skillet over maximum heat and add about 1½ tablespoons of the oil, or enough for a thin layer. When the oil begins to smoke, add the meat in one layer. Let it sit until a brown crust forms, then turn to brown the other side (less than 5 minutes total). Set aside and cover, then repeat with the other half of the meat, adding it to the other half and cover to keep warm.
Add about 2 tablespoons of the oil to the wok and add the onions; stir fry for about 30 seconds, then add the scallions. Add the vinegar mixture; reduce over high heat for about 2 minutes, then add the butter, shaking the pan until the butter melts. Add the beef back into the mixture, stir to combine completely, then serve over a bed of the watercress
