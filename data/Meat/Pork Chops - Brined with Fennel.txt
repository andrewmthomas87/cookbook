½	teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed
2 	tablespoons roughly chopped parsley

Make the brine: Put salt, sugar, bay leaves, peppercorns, allspice and fennel seeds in a bowl. Whisk in 4 cups water to dissolve salt and sugar. Put pork chops in one layer in a glass or plastic container. Pour brine over to completely submerge chops. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably longer, up to overnight. Remove chops from brine and pat dry. Discard brine.
Cook the chops: Set a wide, heavy skillet over high heat and add olive oil. When oil is wavy, add chops in one layer and let brown for about 3 minutes per side. Remove chops from pan and set aside. Reduce heat to medium-high and add sliced onion and fennel, stirring to coat with oil. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until beginning to color, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and crushed fennel seeds and turn down heat.
Lay the chops on top of the onion-fennel mixture,cover and cook, checking temperature with an instant read thermometer until the internal temperature of chops is 140 degrees.
Place chops to a serving platter and cover with the onion-fennel mixture and keep warm. Sprinkle with parsley and garnish with fennel fronds before serving with lemon wedges.
