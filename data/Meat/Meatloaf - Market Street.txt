Meatloaf - Market Street

6-8 servings

3	tablespoons unsalted butter
¾	cup finely chopped onion
¾	cup finely chopped green onion, white and green parts
½	cup finely chopped carrots
¼	cup finely chopped celery
¼	cup minced red bell pepper
¼	cup minced green bell pepper
2	teaspoons minced garlic
Salt to taste
1	teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½	teaspoon white pepper
¼	teaspoon cayenne pepper
1	teaspoon ground cumin
½	teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
3	eggs, well beaten
½	cup ketchup
½	cup half-and-half
2	pounds lean ground beef sirloin
12	ounces sausage meat (not hot)
¼	cup fine fresh bread crumbs, lightly toasted on a cookie sheet in a 300F oven
For the glaze:
½	cup catsup
1	teaspoon ground cumin
Dash Worcestershire sauce
Dash hot pepper sauce
1	tablespoon honey

Preheat oven to 375F.
Melt butter in a heavy skillet, and add the onion, green onions, carrots, celery, bell peppers, and garlic. Cook, stirring often until moisture from the vegetables has evaporated, 10 minutes. Set aside to cool; then refrigerate, covered, until chilled, at least 1 hour.
Combine salt, black pepper, white pepper, cayenne, cumin, nutmeg, and eggs in a mixing bowl and beat well. Add ketchup and half-and-half. Blend thoroughly.
Add the ground beef, sausage, and bread crumbs to the egg mixture. Then add the chilled vegetables and mix thoroughly with your "clean" hands, kneading gently for five minutes.
With damp hands, form mixture into an oval approximately 17 by 4½ by 1½ inches, resembling a loaf of bread.
Place loaf in a baking dish into which it will fit comfortably. Place in oven and bake for ten minutes, then brush on the glaze. Return the meatloaf to the oven and continue cooking for another 35 to 40 minutes. Let meatloaf rest 15 minutes before slicing.
