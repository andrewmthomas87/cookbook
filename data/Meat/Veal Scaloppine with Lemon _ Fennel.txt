Veal Scaloppini with Lemon & Fennel

4 servings

1	head fennel, cored, sliced ¼-inch thick
3	tablespoons plus 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1	pound veal hip or top round
¼	cup flour
½	cup dry white wine
1	cup chicken broth
1	large lemon, zested and juiced
2	tablespoons butter
1	bunch Italian parsley, finely chopped to yield ¼ cup

Core the fennel and cut in half. Cut each half into ⅛ inch julienne.
In a 10 to 12-inch sauté pan, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat until just smoking. Add the fennel and cook, stirring often until soft and golden, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.
Slice the veal into ⅛ inch thick slices. Pound each piece of veal with a meat hammer until nearly paper-thin. Season each piece with salt and pepper and dredge in flour. Heat the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in a 12 to 14-inch sauté pan until smoking. Add 4 pieces of the dredged veal and cook until light golden brown on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and continue with the remaining pieces. When the second batch is browned, add the first batch back to the pan and the wine, chicken broth and lemon juice and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until the liquid is nearly gone. Add the butter, then remove the veal to a platter with the fennel, add the parsley to the sauce and pour it over the meat. Sprinkle with lemon zest and serve.
