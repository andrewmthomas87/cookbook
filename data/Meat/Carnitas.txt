Carnitas

8-10 servings

1	boneless pork butt, 3 ½ pounds, trimmed, cut into 2-inch chunks
1	small onion, peeled, halved
2	cups water
2	bay leaves
1	teaspoon each: ground cumin, dried oregano, salt
½	teaspoon freshly ground pepper
Juice of 1 lime
1	orange, halved
36	corn tortillas (6-inch), warmed
Minced onion, fresh cilantro leaves, thinly sliced radishes, sour cream, lime wedges

Heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine pork, onion and water in a Dutch oven. Add bay leaves, cumin, oregano, salt, pepper and lime juice. Juice the orange into a bowl; remove seeds. Add juice and the juiced orange halves to the pan.
Heat mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Cover; place in the oven. Cook, turning meat halfway through the cooking time, until tender and an inserted fork meets little resistance, 2-2½ hours.
Remove pan from oven; turn oven to broil. Transfer the pork to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Discard the orange halves, onion and bay leaves from the braising liquid. Heat the liquid to a simmer over medium-high heat on the stove top; cook, stirring often, to a syrupy glaze that measures about 1 cup, 8-12 minutes.
Meanwhile, pull each piece of pork in half, using two forks; add to Dutch oven. Toss to coat with braising liquid; season with salt and pepper to taste. Place pork pieces in an even layer on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet or on a broiler pan. Broil until well browned, 5-8 minutes. Turn meat; broil until well browned, 5-8 minutes. Spoon pork into warm tortillas; serve with garnishes.
