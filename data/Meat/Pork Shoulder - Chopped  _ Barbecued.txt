Pork Shoulder - Chopped & Barbecued

4-6 servings

4	pounds boneless pork shoulder, tied
1	tablespoons kosher salt, plus more, to taste
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2	cups apple cider vinegar
1½	teaspoons cayenne pepper
2	teaspoons red pepper flakes
¼	cup firmly packed light brown sugar

Generously season the pork with salt and black pepper. Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 hours.
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the vinegar, cayenne, pepper flakes, brown sugar and the 1 tablespoons of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved. Transfer the mop sauce to a bowl and let cool to room temperature. Let stand for at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. Reserve half of the sauce for serving.
Remove the pork from the refrigerator 1 hour before grilling.
Prepare a medium-low fire in a smoker or other well-insulated charcoal grill.
Place the pork on a V-rack set on a drip pan and set the pan on the grill or smoker. Cover and smoke the meat, maintaining the temperature at about 250°F. After 1 hour, brush the meat on both sides with some of the mop sauce. Continue smoking, brushing and turning the pork every hour, for 6 hours total. Remove the pork from the V-rack and place the meat directly on the grill. Cover and smoke, brushing and turning the pork every hour, until it is tender enough to be pulled, 2 to 4 hours more.
Transfer the pork to a carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 20 minutes. Chop the meat, then transfer to a bowl and toss with the reserved mop sauce. Serve warm with hush puppies.
