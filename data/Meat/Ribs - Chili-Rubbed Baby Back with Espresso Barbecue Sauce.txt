Ribs - Chili-Rubbed Baby Back with Espresso Barbecue Sauce

Makes 4 to 6 servings

2	tablespoons hot Mexican-style chili powder
1	tablespoon paprika
1	tablespoon ground cumin
1½	teaspoons salt
¾	teaspoon ground black pepper
4	pounds baby back pork ribs
1	twelve ounce bottle of dark beer
1	eighteen ounce bottle of good-quality barbecue sauce
½	cup water
2	tablespoons packed golden brown sugar
1	tablespoon instant espresso powder

Preheat oven to 400F. Whisk chili powder, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper in a small bowl to blend. Rub spice mixture all over the ribs. Place the ribs in a heavy large roasting pan.
Boil beer in a medium saucepan until reduced to one cup, about 5 minutes. Pour beer around the ribs. Cover pan tightly with foil. Bake the ribs until they are fork-tender, about 1½ hours.
Combine barbecue sauce, ½ cup of water, brown sugar, and espresso powder in a heavy medium saucepan. Simmer until flavors blend and the sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. (Ribs and barbecue sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool slightly, then cover separately and refrigerate.)
Prepare grill and set on medium heat. Brush the ribs with some of the barbecue sauce. Grill until just heated through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer ribs to platter. Bring remaining sauce to simmer. Brush the ribs with more barbecue sauce. Serve, passing the remaining barbecue sauce separately.
