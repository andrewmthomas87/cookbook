Pork Loin - Apple-Stuffed with Moroccan Spices

6 to 8 servings

4	tablespoons butter
2	apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced
1	large onion, chopped
1	teaspoon ground coriander
1	teaspoon ground cumin
1	teaspoon cinnamon
1	 teaspoon ground ginger
1	teaspoon paprika
½	teaspoon ground turmeric
1	teaspoon salt, or to taste
1		tablespoon black pepper
1	boneless pork loin roast, 2 to 3 pounds
1	cup apple juice for basting

Heat oven to 450F. Put 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When it starts to foam, add the apples, onion and all the spices, along with some salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples and onion are soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, wriggle a thin, sharp knife into each end of the meat, making a kind of pilot hole. Then use the handle of a long wooden spoon to force a hole all the way through the loin. Wriggle the spoon to make the hole as wide as you can. Stuff the apple and onion mixture into the roast from each end, all the way to the center. Sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper.
Roast on a rack in a large roasting pan for 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 325F. Continue to roast, basting with apple juice about every 15 minutes or so. If the liquid accumulates on the bottom of the pan, use it to baste; if not, add more juice.
Start checking the roast after 45 minutes of total cooking time (large roasts can take up to 1½ hours). When it’s done, an instant-read thermometer will register 145F. Remove the roast and set it on a platter.
Put the roasting pan on the stove over one or two burners on medium-high heat. If there is a lot of liquid, reduce it to about ¾ cup, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan; if the pan is dry, add 1 cup of apple juice and follow the same process. When the sauce has reduced some, stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter if you like. Spoon the sauce over the roast, slice and serve.
