Pork Loin with Green Peppercorns

8 servings

1	pork loin, bone in, Frenched and tied (about 5 pounds, 10 bones)
2	tablespoons good olive oil
4	teaspoons Dijon mustard, divided
4	teaspoons whole-grain mustard, divided
1	teaspoon ground fennel seed
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
3	tablespoons all-purpose flour
1	cup good white wine
3	cups chicken stock
¼	cup green peppercorns in brine, drained

Brine the pork tenderloins for 30 minutes in ¼ cup of salt in 2 quarts of water. Remove and dry.
Preheat the oven to 400F. Allow the pork to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Place the pork, fat side up, in a roasting pan just large enough to hold it comfortably. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, 2 teaspoons of each mustard, the fennel seed, 2 teaspoons salt, and ½ teaspoon black pepper. Rub the mixture on top of the pork and roast for 1 to 1¼ hours, until the internal temperature reaches 140F. Remove from the oven, transfer to a cutting board, and cover tightly with aluminum foil for 20 minutes.
For the sauce, remove all but ¼ cup of fat from the roasting pan. If there isn't ¼ cup, add enough butter to the pan to make ¼ cup total. Over medium heat, whisk the flour into the fat in the pan and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and scrape up all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the chicken stock, the remaining 2 teaspoons of each mustard, the green peppercorns, 2 teaspoons salt, and ½ teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened.
Remove the strings from the roast pork, slice between the bones, and serve warm with the hot sauce.
