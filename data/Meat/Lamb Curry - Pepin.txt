Put lamb, onions, garlic, tomatoes, apple, banana, jalapeño, coconut milk, curry powder, cumin, salt, bay leaves and wine into a pressure cooker. Sprinkle the flour on top and mix well.
Bring to a boil over high heat. Secure the lid on the pressure cooker and cook over high heat until 15 pounds pressure (high pressure, if your cooker does not register pounds) is reached. Reduce heat and cook for 25 minutes, maintaining desired pressure.
Decompress the pressure cooker according to the manufacturer's instructions; remove the lid. Remove and discard bay leaves. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary. Ladle over rice; pass cilantro, chutney, coconut and nuts at the table to sprinkle to taste.
Stove-top directions: Instead of using a pressure cooker, you can simmer the curry, covered, in an enameled cast-iron pot until tender, 1¼ to 1½ hours.
