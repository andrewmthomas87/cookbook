Simmer the pork in a small saucepan with 2 cups water, sherry and 1 slice ginger until tender, 30 minutes. Remove the saucepan from heat and let cool. Cut the cooked pork into large slices about ¼ inch thick and reserve the stock for later use.
Put 2 tablespoons of oil in a hot skillet over medium heat. Add salt, then cabbage, stirring constantly for one minute. When the cabbage is half translucent, remove and spread on a plate.
Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining 2 slices ginger, crushed garlic and minced black beans for a few stirrings, then add hot pepper flakes and sliced pork. Pour in the soy sauce, stock and MSG, if using. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Mix in the cooked cabbage and serve immediately.
