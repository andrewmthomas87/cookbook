Beef Brisket - Smoky Spicy

6-8 servings

6	garlic cloves, minced
2	yellow onions, chopped
6	canned chipotle chilies in adobo sauce, drained & chopped, plus ¼ cup sauce
¼	cup honey
1	tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2	teaspoons Dijon mustard
1½	cups lager or other light beer
1	flat-end beef brisket, 3-4 pounds, fat trimmed to ¼ inch
Salt to taste

Combine garlic, onions, chilies, adobo sauce, honey, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and beer in a slow cooker. Season brisket with salt and place in the slow cooker with the fat side up. Cover and cook on high for 8 hours. Transfer brisket and juices to a shallow pan; cool 1 hour, then cover and refrigerate 6-24 hours.
Spoon solidified fat off the juices. Transfer brisket to plate; cover and refrigerate. Transfer juices to a large saucepan. Puree with an immersion blender until only small pieces of onion remain. Set over medium low heat; simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 2 hours.
Prepare medium hot fire in the grill and grill brisket until crispy, 7-10 minutes. Turn the brisket over and grill the other side until crispy, 5-7 minutes, then repeat. Transfer brisket to a carving board; brush with the sauce. Cover with foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice brisket against the grain. Pass remaining sauce alongside when serving.
