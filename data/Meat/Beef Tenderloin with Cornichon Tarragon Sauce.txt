Beef Tenderloin with Cornichon Tarragon Sauce

4 servings

2	pound piece of beef tenderloin, trimmed and tied, at room temperature
2	tablespoons of olive
2	tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
¼	cup minced shallots
1	cup dry white wine
1½	tablespoons minced fresh tarragon leaves or 2 tablespoons crumbled dried
1	tablespoon heavy cream
8	cornichons, cut into julienne strips

Trim & tie the beef tenderloin then marinate in olive oil, white wine, garlic, salt & pepper for one hour at room temperature.
In a small bowl cream the butter with the mustard. In a small saucepan combine the shallots, the wine, and the tarragon and cook the mixture over moderately high heat until the wine is reduced to about ½ cup. The reduction may be made a day ahead, kept covered and chilled, and reheated. Add the cream and the cornichons, reduce the heat to low, and whisk in the mustard butter á little at a time, and any meat juices that have accumulated on the platter.
Rub the tenderloin with olive oil, season it with salt and pepper, and in a small roasting pan, roast it in a preheated 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes or until internal temperature is 125 degrees.
Transfer the tenderloin to a platter and let it stand, covered loosely with foil, for 10 minutes. Season the sauce with salt and pepper and keep it warm, but do not let it boil. Slice the tenderloin and nap it with the sauce.
