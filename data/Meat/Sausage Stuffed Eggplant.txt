Sausage Stuffed Eggplant

4 servings

1	large eggplant
3	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
½	pound sausage
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1	onion, small diced
1	red pepper, small diced
3	cloves garlic, minced
½	cup freshly chopped parsley leaves
½	cup freshly chopped basil leaves, chopped
1¼	cup grated Pecorino Romano, divided
¼	cup bread crumbs
1	egg
2	chopped tomatoes

Preheat oven to 350F.
Cut the eggplant in half and scoop out the center, leaving enough meat inside the skin so that it holds its shape when baked. Boil the scooped-out center part until very soft, about 10 to 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium sauté pan heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Season the sausage with salt and pepper. Add the seasoned sausage to the pan and sauté until all of its liquid is evaporated and the sausage begins to brown slightly. Drain the sausage, removing the extra, unnecessary fat. Let cool briefly and chop the cooked sausage so that there are no large chunks of meat. In another medium sauté pan over medium heat add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and sauté the onions, peppers and garlic together.
In a bowl mix together the cooked eggplant, vegetables, cooked sausage, herbs, 1 cup of the cheese, bread crumbs, and the egg.
Fill the scooped-out eggplant halves with this mixture, dividing it evenly among the 2 halves.
Top with chopped tomatoes and the remaining ¼ cup of grated cheese, season with salt and pepper, place on an oiled oven tray or baking dish, and bake for 50 minutes in preheated oven. Let cool briefly, slice widthwise and serve.
