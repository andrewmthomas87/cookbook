Pork Chops with Balsamic Vinegar

6 servings

6	pork chops
2	tablespoons Dijon mustard
all-purpose flour
1	sprig of fresh sage
1	clove garlic
3	tablespoons butter
2	tablespoons olive oil
4	ounces dry white wine
½	chicken or beef broth cube
4	tablespoons balsamic vinegar
fresh parsley to garnish

Cut away the extra fat from the chops. Coat lightly first with the mustard, then in the flour. Finely chop together the sage and the garlic. In a frying pan, melt the butter and oil until bubbly. Sauté the sage and garlic for a minute. Add the chops and brown well on both sides. Pour the wine over the chops and add the bouillon cube. Cook on low until almost all of the liquid has been absorbed. Drizzle the vinegar over the chops and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Serve hot with a sprinkling of fresh parsley.
