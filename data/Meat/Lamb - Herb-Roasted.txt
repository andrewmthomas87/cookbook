Lamb - Herb-Roasted

10 servings

2	large unpeeled garlic cloves, divided
1	tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2	tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1	boneless leg of lamb (6-pound), trimmed and tied
4	to 5 pounds small unpeeled potatoes (16 to 20 potatoes)
2	tablespoons good olive oil

Preheat the oven to 375F. Place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven so the lamb will sit in the middle of the oven.
Peel 6 of the cloves of garlic and place them in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Add the rosemary, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and butter. Process until the garlic and rosemary are finely minced. Coat the top and sides of the lamb with the rosemary mixture and allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Roast the lamb in a roasting pan for 35 minutes until the internal temperature is 110F as measured with an instant read thermometer. While the lamb is roasting, toss the potatoes and remaining unpeeled garlic in a bowl with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Temporarily remove the lamb and place the potatoes in the bottom of the roasting pan. Place the lamb back on top of the potatoes and roast for 20 minutes more until the internal temperature of the lamb is 128F. Remove from the oven and put the lamb on a platter; cover tightly with aluminum foil. Check the potatoes and put back in the oven to completely cook while the lamb to rests. Slice and serve with the potatoes
