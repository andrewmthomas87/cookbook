Lamb Shanks - Turkish

4 servings

6	to 8 lamb shanks
2	tablespoons tomato paste
½	cup water
1	cup dried plum and its puree
2	tablespoons olive oil
15	slices of  eggplant
chopped hazelnuts or walnuts
1	large onion, diced
red pepper flakes
2	tablespoons flour
2	tablespoons butter
¼	cup milk
salt and pepper
4	rosemary sprigs for garnish

Sauté the lamb shanks with the onion, garlic, celery and leak in a dutch oven, add the tomato paste and the water and simmer for 2½ hours, until the meat falls off the bones. Remove the bones and shred the lamb meat, then add the chopped nuts and mix well. Reduce the pan juices until it turns dark and thickens and set aside.
Boil the plums in water, then remove the seeds and puree in a food processor. Set aside.
Sauté the eggplant in olive oil, then remove seeds and skin. Melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the flour and stir to make a roux. Just before the flour brown, add the milk, then add the eggplant plus salt and pepper. Puree these ingredients to make a puree.
Pack the lamb meat mixture into a 3-inch ramekin to mold. Pour a circle of the pan juices on the plate, then fill the circle with the eggplant puree, which should be light in color. Place the unmolded lamb mixtures on top of the sauces, then put a thin layer of the prune puree on top. Finish with a sprig of rosemary in the center and serve.
