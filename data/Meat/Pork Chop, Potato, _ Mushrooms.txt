Pork Chop, Potato, & Mushrooms

2 servings

2	boneless pork loin chops, about ¾-inch thick
Salt and pepper to taste
1	tablespoon olive oil
8	ounces mushrooms, sliced
2	tablespoons minced garlic
¾	cup dry vermouth
1	teaspoon Dijon mustard
1	tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1	teaspoon dried thyme
1	small onion, thinly sliced
3	small potatoes, thinly sliced
1	tablespoon butter

Preheat oven to 375F. Sprinkle the chops with salt and pepper to taste. Heat the olive oil over high heat in a 10-inch skillet. Add the chops and brown, about 3 minutes per side. Set aside. Add the mushrooms to the same skillet and sauté over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside. Add the garlic, vermouth, mustard and balsamic vinegar to the pan and deglaze over high heat. Add the thyme and continue to reduce until there is about ⅓ cup of liquid. Place the chops in a greased 8 x 8-inch casserole. Brush about ⅓ of the sauce on top of the chops. Place a layer of onions, then mushrooms, on top of the chops. Layer the potatoes over all, overlapping slightly to make them fit. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the butter to the remaining sauce and stir until melted; brush on top of the potatoes. Cover tightly with foil. Bake until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour. Remove foil and continue to bake until potatoes are nicely browned.
