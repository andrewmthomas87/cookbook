Chipotle Meatballs

4 servings

3	slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
3	garlic cloves, peeled (divided use)
2	large eggs
½	cup dried bread crumbs
Salt
1¼	pounds ground pork (or half beef)
½	cup mint leaves, loosely packed & coarsely chopped
1	28-ounce can diced tomatoes with juice (preferably fire roasted)
1	to 2 canned chipotle chiles en adobo, stemmed and seeded
1	to 2 tablespoons chipotle canning sauce
1	teaspoon dried oregano
1½	cups chicken broth (or beef)

Preheat oven to 450F. In a food processor, combine the bacon and 1 garlic clove. Process until finely chopped. Add the eggs, bread crumbs and 1 teaspoon salt. Pulse several times to combine thoroughly, then add the pork (and beef) and mint. Pulse the machine a few more times until everything is well combined, but not at all processed into a paste. Remove the blade
With wet hands, form the meat into 16 plum-size spheres, spacing them out in a 13”x9” baking dish. Bake until lightly browned (they’ll be browned more underneath than on top) about 15 minutes.
While the meatballs are baking, combine the tomatoes, with their juice, chipotles, canning sauce, oregano, the remaining 2 garlic cloves (cut in half) and ½ teaspoon of salt in food processor. Process to a smooth puree.
When the meatballs are ready, spoon off any rendered fat from the baking dish, then pour on the tomato mixture, covering the meatballs evenly. Bake until the sauce look like tomato paste, 15-20 minutes. Divide the meatballs among four dinner plates, leaving most of the sauce behind. (Can be served on pasta at this point.)
Stir enough broth into the sauce to give it an easily spoonable consistency. Microwave the broth for about a minute to heat it. Taste and season with additional salt. Spoon the sauce over the meatballs, decorate with extra mint leaves and serve.
