Beef Rolls - Italian

4 servings

8	thin slices pancetta, plus 2 tablespoons finely chopped pancetta
8	thin boneless beef cutlets (from the eye-round), pounded thinly
1	clove garlic, sliced, plus 1 clove, sliced
1	bunch Italian parsley, finely chopped to yield ¼ cup
1	tablespoon salted capers, rinsed and drained
3	ounces caciocavallo or pecorino, cut into matchsticks
¼	cup extra-virgin olive oil
1	onion, coarsely chopped
1	carrot, chopped
½	cup dry red wine
2	cups canned tomatoes, coarsely chopped
½	teaspoon red pepper flakes
Salt and pepper

Lay a slice of pancetta across each beef cutlet, then sprinkle each with a little finely chopped garlic and some finely chopped parsley. Add a few capers and 1 or 2 pieces of cheese to each cutlet. Roll each up and secure with a toothpick or tie with thread.
In a deep skillet over medium-high heat, brown the beef rolls on all sides in the olive oil. Remove as they brown and set aside.
Add the chopped pancetta to the pan, along with the onion, chopped garlic, and carrot, lower the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft but not brown. Add the wine, increase the heat slightly, and cook, scraping any brown bits. When the wine is reduced by half, add the tomatoes and continue cooking for 5 minutes, to reduce and thicken tomatoes into a sauce.
Stir the pepper flakes into the pan and add the beef rolls, spooning sauce over to cover well. Season with salt and pepper and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pan and cook 25 minutes. Serve immediately
