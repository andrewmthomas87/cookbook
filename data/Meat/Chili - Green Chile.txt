Chili - Green Chile

8-10 servings

1	boneless pork loin roast, 2 pounds
Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
2	tablespoons vegetable oil
2	onions, chopped
4	cloves garlic, finely chopped
2	pounds (about 16) Anaheim peppers, roasted, skinned, seeded, coarsely chopped
2	pounds tomatillos, chopped
6	to 8 cups chicken broth
2	teaspoons ground cumin
2	tablespoons flour
2	tablespoons butter, softened

Season: Rub pork all over with salt (about 1 teaspoon) and pepper (about ¼ teaspoon). Best to do this 1 day ahead, if you've got the time.
Brown: Heat oil over medium-high heat in large heavy pot. Add pork and sizzle brown all over, 15 minutes. Set aside meat. Add onion and cook golden, 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook fragrant, 2 minutes.
Simmer: Return pork to pot. Pour in broth to cover. Heat to a boil; skim foam from surface. Lower heat and simmer, partially covered (adding broth, if need be), until tender, 1½-2 hours.
Shred: Pull out pork. When cool enough to handle, shred, finely. Return shredded meat to the pot. Add peppers, tomatillos and any remaining broth. Season with cumin and a little more salt, if you like. Heat to a boil, lower to a simmer and let flavors meld, partially covered, 1 hour.
Thicken: Mash together flour and butter. Stir into stew and let it thicken, 2 minutes. Serve hot.
