Pork Roast Normandy

8 servings

1	five to six pound boneless pork roast, rolled and tied
2	tablespoons vegetable oil
½	teaspoon fennel seeds
½	teaspoon crumbled dried thyme
½	teaspoons salt
1	teaspoon freshly ground pepper
¼	teaspoon nutmeg
¼	cup all purpose flour
Oil as needed for browning
¾	cup apple cider
1	cup dry white wine
1	cup chicken stock
2	minced garlic cloves
1	cup sour cream

Brine the pork tenderloins for 30 minutes in ¼ cup of salt in 2 quarts of water. Remove and dry.
Rub the roast well with the oil. In a morter, crush the fennel seeds with the pestle and mix well with the remaining dry ingredients. Rub well into the roast.
In a Dutch oven brown the meat on all sides in oil. Add the cider, wine, chicken stock, and garlic. Cover tightly and simmer for 2½ hours or until tender. Remove meat and reduce the juices by one third. Return the meat to the pan juices, cool to room temperature and refrigerate. Keep in refrigerator until the fat congeals. When rady to reheat, skim off the fat and place in a preheated 350F oven for 45 minutes. Transfer meat to a heated serving platter and remove strings. Gradually stir sour cream into the juices. Warm the sauce, but do not boil. Pour some of the sauce over the meat and pass remaining sauce separately
