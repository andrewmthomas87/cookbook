Pork Stew with Sweet & Hot Peppers

8 servings

¼	cup olive oil
2½	pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1½ inch pieces
½	teaspoon salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1	yellow onion, finely chopped
5	garlic cloves, minced
1	tablespoon fennel seeds, toasted in a dry pan, then crushed
½	teaspoon chili pepper flakes
1	can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
1	cup dry red wine
2	green bell peppers, cut into large dice
Red wine vinegar, optional
Chili oil, optional

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the pork on all sides, in batches, seasoning with the salt and pepper to taste as you turn the meat, 8-10 minutes per batch. (Add the remaining oil if needed.) Transfer the meat with a slotted spoon to a plate and set aside.
Decrease the heat to medium; add the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, fennel seeds, and chili pepper; cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and wine; cook to blend flavors, about 5 minutes.
Return the pork to the pan; add the bell peppers. Increase the heat to medium-high; heat to a gentle boil. Decrease the heat to low and cover. Cook until the pork is very tender; 1 to 1½ hours.
Taste; adjust seasonings. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of the vinegar if needed for balance, or sprinkle in a few drops of chili oil for a spicier dish.
