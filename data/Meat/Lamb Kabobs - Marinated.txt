Lamb Kabobs - Marinated

8-12 servings

4	pounds top round lamb shoulder
2	tablespoons minced garlic (4-5 cloves)
2	tablespoons minced rosemary leaves
4	teaspoons minced thyme leaves
½	cup mild olive oil
½	cup dry red wine
4	tablespoons red wine vinegar
Kosher salt
4	small red onions
4	pints cherry tomatoes
Wooden skewers
For the sauce:
1	cup chicken stock
½	cup good olive oil
2	tablespoons lemon juice
¼	teaspoon minced rosemary leaves
½	teaspoon kosher salt
½	teaspoon ground black pepper

Cut the lamb in 1½ inch cubes. You should have about 40 cubes. Combine the garlic, rosemary, thyme, olive oil, red wine, vinegar, and 1 teaspoon of salt in a medium bowl. Add the lamb cubes, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight or for up to 2 days. Toss occasionally.
Heat a charcoal grill with coals. Spread the coals in 1 tight layer on the grill.
Cut the red onions in quarters and separate each quarter into 3 or 4 sections. Loosely thread 3 or 4 pieces of lamb alternately with sections of onion on skewers. Sprinkle both sides of the lamb with salt and pepper. Next place 4 or 5 cherry tomatoes on skewers, threading them through the stem of the tomato. Rub the tomatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. First, place the lamb skewers on the hot grill and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, turning 2 or 3 times, until the lamb is medium rare. Approximately 5 minutes before the lamb is done, place the tomato skewers on the grill, turning once, until seared on the outside but still firm inside.
For the sauce, bring the chicken stock, olive oil, and lemon juice to a boil in a medium pot. Lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, until reduced in half. Add the rosemary, ½ teaspoon of salt, and the pepper. Serve the sauce on the side.
