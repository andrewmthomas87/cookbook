Pork Chops with Rosemary, Sage & Garlic

4 servings

4	pork chops, about 1Â½-inch thick
Salt and pepper to taste
2	tablespoons olive oil
2	tablespoons butter
2	tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped
2	tablespoons fresh sage, chopped
2	tablespoons minced garlic
1	teaspoon medium grind black pepper
1	teaspoon salt
2	cups dry white wine
2	tablespoons all-purpose flour

Mix the rosemary, sage, garlic, salt, and pepper into a thick paste in a pestle.
Trim fat from four thick-cup pork chops, then coat with the spice paste on both sides.
Heat olive oil and butter in an electric skillet, then sear the pork chops about 3 minutes per side until browned. Add enough wine to the skillet to cover the bottom half of the pork chops. Bring the wine to a boil, then reduce heat to a bare simmer. Cover and simmer for about 25 minutes, until pork chops are cooked in the center. Check for doneness by piercing the center with a slim knife.
Remove the pork chops from the pan. Mix the flour with water to make a slurry, then add to the skillet and stir to make a thick herbal gravy.
Serve with garlic mashed potatoes.
