Beef Filets with Blue Cheese & Chilies

6 servings

6	eight ounce filets of beef tenderloin with fat trimmed off
1½	tablespoons olive oil
3	teaspoons minced fresh parsley, divided
2	garlic cloves, minced
2	ounces cream cheese, room temperature
¼	cup finely crumbled blue cheese (about 1 ounce)
2	tablespoons finely chopped seeded red or green jalapeno chiles
1	shallot, finely chopped
¾	teaspoon white wine vinegar

Combine olive oil, 2 teaspoons parsley, and garlic in an 8x8x2-inch glass dish. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Add steaks to the dish and turn to coat. Marinate steaks 30 minutes or cover and chill up to 1 day.
Mix cream cheese, blue cheese, chilies, shallot, vinegar, and the remaining 1 teaspoon parsley in a medium bowl. Season blue cheese topping to taste with salt and pepper.
Prepare barbeque (medium-high heat)). Place steaks on the grill rack. Some marinade should still cling to the meat. Cook for 5 minutes. Turn steaks over, divide blue cheese topping among the steaks. Grill until topping softens and steaks are medium rare, about 5 minutes longer.
