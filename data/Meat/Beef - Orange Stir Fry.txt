4 servings

1	pound beef tenderloin, trimmed and cut into ¼-inch x 1-inch pieces (across the grain)
1	large orange – cut in quarters
3	green onions, minced
3	tablespoons soy sauce
1	tablespoon oriental sesame oil
1	teaspoon hot chili oil
1	tablespoon mirin (syrupy rice wine)
2	tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
2	large garlic cloves, finely minced
1	teaspoon sugar
½	teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
2	medium carrots, matchstick julienne
1	cup thinly sliced water chestnuts
½	pound snow peas, strings removed, large ones cut diagonally
2	tablespoons beef or chicken broth
3	green onions, matchstick julienne

Wrap beef tenderloin tightly in plastic and freeze until firm but not solid.
Cut beef across grain into ¼-inch slices, then each slice into ¼-inch by ¼-inch pieces, then cut those pieces diagonally into approximately 1-inch lengths. Place in a large bowl for marinating. Cut orange into half and each half into quarters, and then remove all meat & pith from peel, leaving eight thin triangular pieces of orange peel. Stack and cut these pieces into matchstick julienne. Mix orange peel, minced green onions, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil, mirin, ginger, garlic, sugar, and dried red pepper flakes into the beef and marinate 45 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature, stirring occasionally.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil in a wok or heavy large skillet over high heat. Add carrots, water chestnuts, and snow peas and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add broth, reduce heat to low, cover, and steam for 2 additional minutes. Mix in green onion julienne. Transfer vegetables to a large bowl using a slotted spoon. Add chili oil to wok, increase heat to high and cook for 1 minute. Add beef with the marinade. Stir-fry until most juices have evaporated but meat is still rare, about 2 minutes. Return vegetables to wok and stir until heated through, about 1 minute.
Serve immediately over steamed rice.
