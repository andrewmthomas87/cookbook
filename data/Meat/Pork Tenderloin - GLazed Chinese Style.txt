Pork Tenderloin – Glazed Chinese Style

4-6 servings

2 (12- to 16-ounce) pork tenderloins, trimmed
½	cup soy sauce
½	cup apricot jelly
¼	cup hoisin sauce
¼	cup dry sherry
2	tablespoons grated fresh ginger
1	tablespoon toasted sesame oil
2	garlic cloves, minced
1	teaspoon five-spice powder
1	teaspoon pepper
¼	cup ketchup
1	tablespoon molasses
2	teaspoons vegetable oil

Lay tenderloins on cutting board with long sides running parallel to counter edge. Cut horizontally down length of tenderloins, stopping ½ inch from edge so halves remain intact. Working with one at a time, open up tenderloins, place between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, and pound to ¾-inch thickness.
Combine soy sauce, jelly, hoisin sauce, sherry, ginger, sesame oil, garlic, five-spice powder, and pepper in bowl. Reserve ¾ cup marinade. Place pork in large zipper-lock bag and pour remaining marinade into bag with pork. Seal bag, turn to coat, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.
Combine reserved marinade, ketchup, and molasses in small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until syrupy and reduced to ¾ cup, 3 to 5 minutes. Reserve ¼ cup glaze for glazing cooked tenderloin.
Clean and oil cooking grate. Pat pork dry with paper towels, then rub with vegetable oil. Grill pork until lightly charred on first side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brush grilled side of pork evenly with 2 tablespoons glaze. Continue grilling until lightly charred on second side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brush evenly with 2 tablespoons glaze. Repeat flipping and glazing twice more, until pork registers 140 degrees and is thickly glazed, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer pork to cutting board and brush with reserved glaze. Tent loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice and serve.
