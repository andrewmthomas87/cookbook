Meatballs a la Pizzaiola

36 meatballs

Vegetable oil cooking spray
2	large shallots, peeled and chopped
¼	cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained (5 or 6)
1/	 cup packed fresh basil leaves
⅓	cup shredded mozzarella
¼	cup grated Parmesan
1	tablespoon tomato paste
2	teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
1½	teaspoons kosher salt
1½	pounds 20-percent fat ground beef
1	pound ground pork
6	ounces smoked mozzarella, cut into 36 half-inch cubes
⅓	cup olive oil
3	cups marinara sauce, warmed

Preheat the oven to 350F. Spray a baking sheet with vegetable oil cooking spray. Set aside.
In a food processor, pulse together the shallots, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, shredded mozzarella, Parmesan, tomato paste, red pepper flakes, and salt. Process until blended. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the beef and pork and, using a wooden spoon or clean hands, stir until well combined. Form the mixture into 36 equal-size meatballs (about 1¼ to 1½ inches in diameter).
Poke a finger into the center and insert 1 cube smoked mozzarella cheese into the center of each meatball and form the meat around it, completely enclosing the cheese.
In a large nonstick skillet, heat half the oil over medium heat. Add half of the meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining oil and meatballs.
Place the browned meatballs onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes for medium doneness. Set aside to cool slightly, and serve with warm marinara sauce.
