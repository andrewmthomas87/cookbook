Beef Steaks - Pan-Sautéed with Garlic-Mustard Sauce

6 servings

6 	six-ounce boneless rib-eye steaks (1 inch thick), excess fat trimmed
1½	 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
2	tablespoon vegetable oil
3	tablespoon ninced garlic
½	cup dry red wine
½	cup beef broth
4	teaspoon country-style Dijon mustard
4½	tablespoon butter, cut into pieces
3	tablespoon minced fresh parsley

Season steaks on both sides with salt. Rub pepper into both sides of each steak. Divide oil between 2 heavy large skillets and heat over medium-high heat. Add 3 steaks to each skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 3½ minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to platter. Tent with foil to keep warm. Divide garlic between skillets; sauté 30 seconds. Divide wine between skillets; boil until reduced by half, stirring up any browned bits, about 1 minute. Combine contents of skillets in 1 skillet. Add broth and mustard and whisk until blended. Boil until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Add butter; whisk just until melted. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over steaks. Top with parsley.
