Ham & Cabbage Pie

6-8 servings

6	russet potatoes, peeled & quartered
10	tablespoons butter
6	tablespoons flour
¾	cup chopped fresh parsley
1	head Savoy cabbage, chopped
1½	cups half and half milk
3	scallions, finely chopped
1½	pounds baked ham, diced (smoked turkey ham works well)
Salt and pepper

Preheat oven to 400F. Boil or steam potatoes until soft. Melt 6 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and whisk for 2 minutes. Add milk and cook, stirring often, until sauce thickens, 8-10 minutes. Add parsley and salt and pepper to taste, set aside.
Boil cabbage in a medium pot of boiling salted water over high heat until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Drain potatoes and mash until smooth. Stir in the remaining 4 tablespoons of the butter, the cream, scallions, and salt and pepper to taste. Set side.
Scatter the diced ham in the bottom of a large baking dish, cover with the cabbage, then the sauce, followed by the mashed potatoes. The potatoes can be piped through a pastry bag fitted with a ½-inch star tip. Bake until bubbling hot and golden on top, 30-35 minutes.
