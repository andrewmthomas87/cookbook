Beef Brisket with Root Vegetables

8 servings

4	medium sweet onions, quartered
4	carrots, cut into 1-inch lengths
4	large red potatoes, quartered
3	parsnips, cut into 1-inch lengths
4	beef bouillon cubes, crumbled
¼	cup firmly packed light brown sugar
2	tablespoons each: sweet paprika, flour
1	tablespoon garlic salt
2	teaspoons dried thyme
1	teaspoon each: onion powder, celery seeds
½	teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1	brisket, 2½ pounds, trimmed

Combine the onions, carrots, potatoes and parsnips in the insert of a 5- to 7-quart slow cooker. Mix the bouillon, brown sugar, paprika, flour, garlic salt, thyme, onion powder, celery seeds and pepper together in a small bowl. Rub the mixture over the brisket; transfer the brisket to the cooker. (If the brisket is too large, cut it in half and stack to fit.) Cover the cooker; cook on low until the brisket is tender, 10 hours (or on high, 6 hours).
Remove the brisket from the cooker; cover with aluminum foil. Lift the vegetables from the sauce; arrange on a platter. Cover with foil. Skim off any fat from the sauce; keep sauce warm. Thinly slice the brisket across the grain; arrange over the top of the vegetables; spoon some of the sauce over. Serve remaining sauce in a gravy boat.
Adaptations for the pressure cooker: Cook the rubbed meat with 2 cups of water in the cooker 45-50 minutes. Release the pressure; add the vegetables. Bring it back up to pressure; cook 4 minutes. Release pressure; serve.
