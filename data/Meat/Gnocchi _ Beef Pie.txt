Gnocchi & Beef Pie

6 servings

¼	cup extra-virgin olive oil
2	pounds beef, cut into cubes
Salt and pepper
2	medium onions, finely chopped
4	stalks celery, finely chopped
5	cloves garlic, sliced
1	carrot, finely chopped
1	can (16-ounce) peeled tomatoes, drained and crushed
2	cups red wine
1	teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
Pinch nutmeg
Pinch cloves
Pinch cinnamon
½	cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated

In a 6 to 8-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat.
Season the beef cubes well with salt and pepper and brown them over high heat on all sides. Remove the beef from the pan and add the onion, celery, and garlic. Sweat over medium heat until vegetables are translucent. Return the beef to the pan and stir in the tomatoes and wine. Add the thyme, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and salt and pepper, to taste, and simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 1½ hours, until the beef cubes are falling apart. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and remove from heat. Remove the beef and, when it is cool enough to handle, shred the meat with a fork and return to the sauce. Simmer for an additional 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the gnocchi according to the recipe, then preheat the oven to 400F.
(See separate recipe for Gnocchi). Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water for 1 minute, then drain, and place in a lightly greased casserole. Pour the beef sauce over the gnocchi to cover, top with the grated cheese and cook in the oven 10 to 15 minutes, until the ragu is bubbling at the edges and the cheese is browned. Let sit for 10 minutes, then serve.
