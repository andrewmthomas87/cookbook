Pork Chops - Spiced Kurobuta

4 servings

1	tablespoon ground Aleppo pepper (Syria)
1	tablespoon Hungarian sweet paprika
2	teaspoons coarse kosher salt
2	teaspoons black, freshly ground pepper
1	teaspoon chopped fresh sage leaves
4	pork chops (1¼ to 1½-inches thick)
5	tablespoons olive oil, divided
⅓	cup all purpose flour
Braised bacon, pomegranate and pine nut relish (recipe below)
8	whole green cardamom pods
1	pound slab of bacon, cut into ½-inch cubes
2	cups low-salt chicken broth
3	tablespoons pomegranate molasses
½	cup pine nuts, toasted
⅓	cup fresh pomegranate seeds

Mix Aleppo pepper, paprika, coarse salt, ground Malabar pepper, and fresh sage in a small bowl. Brush pork on both sides with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle generously with all of the spice mixture, press to adhere. Spread flour on a plate; dredge pork in the flour, and shake off excess.
Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until brown, 3 minutes per side. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork registers 145F, about 10 minutes.
Serve the pork chops with the Braised Bacon, Pomegranate, and Pine Nut Relish.
Relish Instructions:
Stir cardamom in a small skillet over medium heat until pods are lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Cool slightly. Crack pods, remove seeds and crush in a mortar with pestle; reserve.
Bring a medium saucepan of water to boil. Add bacon and cook for 30 seconds. Drain, then combine bacon and the chicken broth in the same saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently until almost all of the liquid is absorbed, about 35 minutes. Wipe away any grease from the pan. Add pomegranate molasses, then the pine nuts, pomegranate seeds, and crushed cardamom seeds to the pan. Bring to a simmer; cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with pepper.
