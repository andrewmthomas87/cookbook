Brine the pork tenderloins for 30 minutes in ¼ cup of salt in 2 quarts of water. Remove and dry.
Preheat oven to 450F. Coat a roasting pan with cooking spray.
Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Remove from pan, reserving fat in pan, and crumble into small pieces. To the same pan, add squash and onion and cook 3 minutes, until onion is soft. Remove from heat, add to a large bowl with the crumbled bacon, bread crumbs, ½ cup of the blue cheese, 2 tablespoons of the sage, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon black pepper. Mix well.
Butterfly pork on a flat surface and spread stuffing evenly over meat. Roll up pork and tie with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals. Season pork all over with salt and black pepper and transfer to prepared pan. Roast 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325F and bake 45 more minutes, until an instant-read thermometer registers 160F for medium-well. Let pork rest 10 minutes before cutting crosswise into 1-inch thick slices.
In a small saucepan, whisk together chicken broth, sherry and cornstarch. Set pan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add remaining 2 tablespoons blue cheese and tablespoon of sage and simmer 1 minute, until sauce thickens. Remove from heat and season, to taste, with salt and black pepper. Serve ½ of the pork with all of the sauce spooned over top..
