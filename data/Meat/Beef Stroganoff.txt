Beef Stroganoff

4 servings

2	pounds of beef tenderloin cut into 3”x1” strips
3	tablespoons olive oil
3	tablespoons butter
Salt & freshly ground pepper
½	pound sliced button mushrooms
3	tablespoons finely chopped shallots or scallions
¼	teaspoon Tabasco Sauce
½	teaspoon dried tarragon or 1 tablespoon fresh tarragon
1	tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce
1	tablespoon tomato past (optional)
1	cup sour cream or more to taste
1	pound egg noodles, cooked al dente
¼	cup chopped parsley

Heat the butter and oil in a heavy skillet and brown the beef quickly on both sides. Salt & pepper, transfer to a platter & cover with aluminum foil. Add the shallots or scallions to the skillet, more freshly ground pepper. Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté briefly, then add the Tabasco, tarragon, Worcestershire, and tomato paste. Blend thoroughly. Remove the skillet from the heat and carefully stir in the sour cream, then heat through gently. Do not let it boil, which will curdle the sour cream. Spoon the sauce over the beef. Serve both over the egg noodles and garnish with chopped parsley.
