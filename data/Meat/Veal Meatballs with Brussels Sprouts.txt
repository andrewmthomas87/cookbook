Veal Meatballs with Brussels Sprouts

6 servings

2	pounds ground veal chuck
2	eggs, lightly beaten
⅔	cup drained and diced oil-packed sundried tomatoes
⅔	cup peeled and grated white onion
½	cup julienned fresh basil
⅓	cup fresh, fine white bread crumbs
⅓	pound minced pancetta or bacon (uncooked)
1	teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2½	cups chicken stock
¼	cup olive oil
1	medium carrot, peeled and finely diced
1	stalk of celery, finely diced
1	pound (20 to 24 sprouts) fresh Brussels sprouts, trimmed and very thinly sliced with a knife or mandolin (about 3 cups)
½	to ¾ cup chopped parsley

Crumble the veal into a large mixing bowl. Add the eggs. Sprinkle the sundried tomatoes, onions, basil, bread crumbs, pancetta and pepper evenly over the meat and mix until just combined. Divide evenly into 32 walnut-sized meatballs, each about 1-inch in diameter (about 1.5-ounce portions). Use a small ice cream scoop, if desired.
Heat the stock in a small pot, cover and set aside.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a 12-inch sauté pan over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Working in 3 batches, sear the meatballs, rolling them around the pan until brown, about 4 minutes per batch. Don't crowd the pan; they should brown, not steam. Transfer to a plate.
Add the carrots, celery and Brussels sprouts to the pan. Stir and cook until they soften, about 3 minutes. Return meatballs and their juices to the pan. Add the hot stock, cover and simmer on low heat about 10 minutes.
